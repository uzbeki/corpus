Shamir agrees to talks,Barry Schweid,Anaheim Bulletin,english,"JERUSALEM     Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir accepted on Thursday a U.S. formula for historic Middle East peace talks with the Arabs, saying Secretary of State James A. Baker III had assured him the issue of Palestinian representation would be resolved to Israel's satisfaction. On that basis, Shamir agreed to submit the proposal to the Israeli Cabinet on Sunday. A senior U.S. official said he was confident of approval. An exultant Baker said a conference with face-to-face negotiations between Israel and its Arab neighbor""no longer simply a dream."" Shamir told an Israeli television interviewer, ""We have agreements with representatives of the United States on the makeup of the Palestinian delegation. There will be no PLO men there; there will be no residents of east Jerusalem and there will be no people from the Palestinian diaspora. ""President Bush and Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev announced Wednesday in Moscow that they intended to convene the peace conference in October, and Bush sent Baker to Israel to deal with final sticking points. Baker said work remained to be done before the peace conference could be held. But he said Shamir had given him ""the yes we were hoping for from the Israelis."" Shamir said, ""It appears thatthe United States has not yet come to agreement with the other side."" And, indeed, a leading Palestinian activist who has been mentioned in the past as a possible negotiator reacted with skepticism to the Israeli's acceptance. ""I cannot say that what we heard from Mr. Shamir is a real yes, because it is with a condition,"" said Faisal Husseini, who said he needed to hear more specific information from Baker. Baker is to meet with a Palestinian delegation Friday morning. Shamir, asked about chances the peace conference would finally occur, said, ""I think that all the efforts vested by the United States, and with the help of the Soviet Union ... I assume that it will take place."" Israel has fought five wars with its Arab neighbors since its establishment in 1948. Only Egypt, in 1979, has agreed to peace with the Jewish state.",1991, August 2 
Morbid curiosity,Vik Jolly,Anaheim Bulletin,english,"ANAHEIM     A stolen religious statue and two tombstones were recovered and two teenagers arrested at a home that initally alarmed police with its morbid decor.

Alejos and Nalaina Sunt, 18, of Fountain Valley were booked into Orange County jail on charges of grand theft. Alejos was released Thursday on his own recognizance. Hunt was released on bail. Investigators found the inside of Alejos' house decorated with dark curtains, little lighting and drawings of skulls, heavy metal music posters and other inscriptions.

Bush backs Gorbachev's efforts to maintain unity,Brian Friedman,Anaheim Bulletin,english,"KIEV, U.S.S.R.     President Bush admonished restless Soviet republics on Thursday to av""hopeless course of isolation"" in their bid for more freedom. He warmly endorsed Mikhail Gorbachev's formula for holding the fractious nation together. Before ending a three-day Soviet visit, Bush also made a pilgrimage to Babi Yar, placing a wreath at the forested ravine where Nazis slaughtered Jews by the tens of thousands 50 years ago and vowing that ""this sort of murder will never happen again."" He used the stop here in the Ukraine as a platform to counsel restraint upon the republics in their demands for autonomy from Moscow. ""We cannot tell you how to reform your society,"" said Bush, standing beneath a towering marble statue of Lenin in the Ukrainian parliament. ""We will not try to pick winners and losers in political competition between republics ... and the center."" That is your business. That's not the business of the United States of America, ""he said. He rejected what he called ""a false choice"" between supporting Gorbachev or ""independence-minded leaders throughout the U.S.S.R."" But Bush lavished praise on the leader he left behind in Moscow, saying Gorbachev ""has achieved astonishing things."" ""His policies of glasnost, perestroika and democratization point toward the goals of freedom, democracy and economic liberty,"" said Bush. To grumbles from some Ukrainian lawmakers, Bush praised the Union Treaty that Gorbachev and leaders of nine republics struck in April to hold nine republics together in a federation while loosening Kremlin control. Six other republics, including the three Baltic states, have disdained the treaty. The United States has never recognized the Soviet annexation of Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia. ""We will maintain the strongest possible relationship with the Soviet government of President Gorbachev,"" said Bush. ""But we also appreciate the new realities of life in the U.S.S.R. and therefore, as a federation ourselves, we want good relations, improved relations, with the republics."" Bush spent six hours in this second-most-populous of Soviet republics before embarking on a 10-hour journey back to Washington.",1991, August 2

9 year old arrested with squirt gun part of crime wave,Mitchell Landsberg,Anaheim Bulletin,english,"For four hot hours recently, Healdsburg, Calif., was a safer, drier place. Carin Lieberman, squirt gun assailant, was behind bars. The citizenry could also breathe easier in Thonotosassa, Fla., when Tammy Toloff, 9-yearold pebble thrower, was hauled away in handcuffs. Crime? You want to hear about crime? In Cobb County, Ga., Rebecca Anding was thrown right into the clink on Easter Sunday after she was caught in the act of picking tulips for her grandmother's grave. But folks have come to expect the worst in Cobb County, which is also home to Linda Judson, who allegedly FAILED TO RETURN TWO VIDEOTAPES! You can bet they put her behind bars.

Her court hearing is Friday, and she could be jailed if she refuses to pay a fine. What's going on here? Isn't this a nation awash in drugs and violence, serial killers and Leona Helmsley? In short, don't police have anything better to do? Well, maybe, some law enforcement officials say. On the other hand, a crime is a crime, isn't it? ""You get criticized if you do something and you get criticized if you don't,"" complained Police Chief David G. Walchak of Concord, N.H., speaking as a vice president of the International Association of Chiefs of Police. ""The tendency,"" he added, ""is to err on the side of caution.""

Sociologist Jack Levin, a professor at Northeastern University in Boston, sees something big happening here. ""I see this as a very large trend,"" said Levin.

Baker seeking to draw Palestinians to talks,Serge Schmemann,Anaheim Bulletin,english,"AMMAN, Jordan     Armed with Israel's conditional agreement to a Middle East peace conference, Secretary of State James A. Baker III on Friday sought to convince the Palestinians, the last party yet to agree, that even if they accepted Israel's terms they still stood to gain the most from the process. Baker first met for four hours with three prominent Palestinians in Jerusalem, then flew to the Jordanian capital, Amman, for talks with King Hussein. Under the American plan, the Palestinians would take part in the first stage of the peace conference in a delegation with Jordan.

Court rules for Talley,Andrew Silva,Anaheim Bulletin,english,"ANAHEIM    An appeals court has decided that former city manage r William O.

The 4th District Court of Appeal ruled Tuesday that the Angels are not entitled to recover about $5 million in legal fees the team has incurred during its five year fight with Ta""I was pleased to see the appeals court affirmed that the Angels actedimproperly,"" Talley said. Talley has countersued Golden West Baseball Co., which owns the Angels, alleging the organization went after him in order to force him out of his job to get a better deal with the city. That suit is moving forward, he said. Richard Brown, chief executive officer of the Angels, wouldn't comment on the decision. Talley, who is now city manager in Dana Point, was sued in 1985 and the suit was thrown out in 1988, but the Angels appealed. The city was responsible for Talley's legal fees, so the city also is now off the hook. ""I'm pleased the appeals court upheld the superior court decision,"" Council- man Tom Daly said. ""The Angels have a history of appealing court decisions they don't like ... I think the city's always dealt in good faith with the Angels and they've prolonged this needlessly.""

Bush says only poor health would stop re-election bid,Michael Wines,Anaheim Bulletin,english,"WASHINGTON     President Bush all but announced his intention to seek re-election at a Rose Garden news conference Friday, saying only a change in his health would deter him from seeking a second term. Bush then tested a potential campaign theme by accus""frustratingly negative"" Congress of blocking his domestic legislative agenda. As if determined to allay any lingering concerns about his health, Bush declared, "" I feel like a million dollars,"" and said he was extraordinarily ""blessed"" for a man of 67. The remarks, his first since his return from the Soviet Union, were aimed at Democrats who this week accused him of abandoning social and financial problems at home for the glitter of global summitry. When asked about his re-election plans, Bush was initially coy, saying he had not decided whether to try for a second term and might not do so until next year. But moments later, he added that he knew of nothing that would stop him from making such a bid. ""I'll be honest, the only thing would be a health problem, and I don't have one right now,"" Bush said. ""But, I mean it wouldn't be fair to the American people to ask to be re-elected knowing that you, in your heart of hearts, might feel you couldn't finish the job. But I don't feel that way. ""With that comment, Bush edged close to making the formal announcement that he said he would make early next year. Although incumbent presidents are usually reticent about announcing for a second term, Bush's strong hint may have been intended to scotch rumors among some Bush family friends that his wife, Barbara , might oppose a second term for health reasons. Bush stressed his feeling several times that he had fully recovered from the heart arrhythmia and thyroid problems he experienced in the spring. The White House later said Bush had been examined by his doctor, Burton Lee, and pronounced in ""excellent health."" The president said he would discuss his prospects for a second term with his Washington political advisers this weekend at the presidential retreat in Camp David, Md. The White House press office declined to disclose who would attend that meeting, saying Bush did not wish to publicly embarrass anyone left out. Associates of Bush said that the meeting was to be an informal gathering meant to convey the message that the president was serious about preparing for a second term and that no one should be lulled into overconfidence by his current political popularity. Those associates later said that a mix of Bush's current advisers and veterans of his 1981 and 1984 races for the White House would go to Camp David. They included Robert Teeter, Bush's pollster; Frederic V. Malek, an airline executive and longtime political friend; Commerce Secretary Robert A. Mosbacher; Vice President Dan Quayle; Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady; Ronald Kauf- man, a White House staff member and political adviser.",1991, August 2

Also injured in the crash were Sandoval's friends John Bowers, 19, and Manny Germinaro. Marco Gonzalez, 17, was treated and released shortly after the pre-dawn crash. A half-dozen former football players gathered at UCI Medical Center Friday afternoon where Bowers was listed in fair condition with bruises to his heart and lung. Germinaro was in fair condition with a broken arm. Only family members were allowed to visit. Bowers' family declined to talk to the press. Sandoval graduated in 1990 and was attending Fullerton College. ""They weren't risk takers,"" said Mark Manley, who also played ball with Sandoval. ""I'm more mad than sad.

Sandoval, Bowers, Germinaro and Becerra all lived within a mile of each other and spent a lot of time together. ""The way it happened didn't follow at all,"" Becerra said. Though he didn't know Rodriquez well, Becerra said, ""From what I heard, he was a bunch of trouble."" The young men's favorite activity was staging the ""mud bowl"" every time it rained. They would get together for a wild game of very sloppy football. Becerra said one day he broke free during a play and Sandoval yelled, ""Get that wetback,"" and Becerra slipped and fell laughing in the mud. All the young men spoke highly of the three friends.

Park residents still angered by fireworks,Anne M. Peterson,Anaheim Bulletin,english,"ANAHEIM     Patsy Krueger is literally sick of Disneyland's nightly firework "" I got deathly sick over it '' she said. "" I always slept with my window open."" Krueger is one of about 80 resdents at the Anaheim Harbor RV Park who have complained about air and noise pollution from Disneyland's nightly fire- work shows. And they say Disney's response to their complaints isn't enough. Disneyland earlier this week sent claims assessors to the park to advise residents about what they would be paid or reimbursed for damage done to their vehicles by the fireworks. The park residents filed a petition two weeks ago saying the fireworks are a public nuisance because of debris that falls down and damages their vehicles. Although Disneyland stopped using 8-inch shells that pyrotechnicians determined to be the cause of the fallout, the RV park residents are less than satisfied with the response. Bob Izykowski, leader of the petition drive, said the fireworks must stop. He has debris ranging from 3 inches in diameter to about a 6- inch cardboard cylinder that he has picked up in the park and on neighboring Ball Road. Not only has ash collected on his vehicles, but large pieces of cardboard fall down every night. Izykowski said. ""If someone throws a cigarette out of a car, they get in trouble,"" he said. ""But it hasn't changed (because of the claims adjusters). It irritates me. Just because they're Disneyland, it doesn't give them the right to do this every night."" Izykowski said wind during the 9:30 p.m. show blows the debris onto the top of his motorhome. ""It's like burnt charcoal,"" he said. Kama Thulin has lived at the RV park for about two months and said when she arrived with her new truck, ""It didn't have a mark on it. ""The ash falls down like snow every night,"" she said. ""The dew later on at night mixes with it and it creates a chemical reaction."" Izykowski and Thulin said that they still find debris on their vehicles even though the eight-inch shells have been eliminated. ""It's unbelievable,"" Thulin said. ""It still comes down. We're subject to the wind here. I don't know what they think they've done but we want a continuous solution because it's going to be a continuous problem. ""Look at the finish.

A costly golf game and other firn,Tim Sosbe,Anaheim Bulletin,english,"This week I received a phone call and a letter, both questioning the legitimacy of the city's budget crisis, or at least the wisdom of our officials. We've spoken often about the crisis, so you know how badly the city leaders say our financial conditions are. In fact, City Manager Jim Ruth met with his managers July 25 and told them to come up with ways to cut budgets. But that's not what caught the attention of the readers. The meeting was early in the day. Afterward, the officials adjourned to the annual golf party with Mouseland folks, this year at Anaheim Hills Country Club. The letter-writer sent me a small article about the golf game. This person wanted to know, understandably, what budget crisis there is? Obviously, the leaders can still afford time off for a round of golf. The caller also thought it seemed strange, and wondered if those who played have given up a day's pay and forked over money for green fees. After all, the caller said, why should taxpayers pay for employees to play golf on city time? ""That's just about the way you feel when you know about something like that transpiring,"" the caller said. ""They meet in time of crisis on fiscal matters and cut everything 25 percent. But, let's go play golf before the day is gone."" The caller also praised Mayor Pro Tem Bill Ehrle, who changed his vote and killed the 4 percent utilities tax. ""He deported himself like a truly effective politician,"" the caller said. ""He realized the vox populi had spoken and as a representative, he represented them Speaking of the 4 percent utilities tax, I received a letter on that also. Ehrle may have been able to kill the tax, with help from councilmen Tom Daly and Irv Pickler, but that doesn't mean we won't be paying more for the same after all.

Do not, though, think what you say will do anything other than allow you to get it off your chest.

Among the potential candidates are Keith Olesen, a community activist who chaired the city's gang and drug task force; Frank E. Feldhaus Jr., a former city planning commissioner; Frank Turner, a Los Angeles County fire captain; Ed Skinner, the owner of a concrete mixing company and Gregory Ramsay, a health care executive. Community college professor Phil Knypstra, activist Mel Aguilar, law student Todd Kaudy, college student Manuel Ontiveros and bakery manager Donna D'Anella also have taken out papers to run for council.

"Buick tops hit list of favorites among car thieves, police say",Terri Vermeulen,Anaheim Bulletin,english,"If you've got a Buick, you'd better keep a close eye on it. The domestic-made vehicles are the most likely target of car thieves in Orange County at a time when the number of auto thefts is jumping dramatically, police said. The large cars are especially popular among gang members, said Lt. Dave Stuflick of the California Highway Patrol. Also on the hit list of Orange County's auto thieves are Hondas, Chevrolets, Hyundais and Toyotas. Hondas are particularly popular for their parts, while thieves like the Toyota's sound system, Stuflick said. Though the year is barely half over, auto thefts in Orange County already have surpassed last year's total of 20,000 stolen cars, he said. About 85 percent of the cars are stolen for joyrides or parts. ""The chances are much greater than 10 years ago,"" Stuflick said. As the rash of auto thefts grows, police urge drivers to exercise more caution when leaving their vehicles. Anti-theft devices such as The Club, alarms,ignition kill switches and window etching often discourage prospective auto thieves, Stuflick told residents at a recent crime prevention seminar at Anaheim City Hall. But police often recover cars when anti-theft devices haven't been used. ""The greatest impact is to take your keys, lock your car and roll up the window,"" Stuflick said. Scratches, dents or other unique marks on cars also should be noted so the vehicles can be identified easily if they are found, he added. Police and other local officials also offered the following tips to keep auto thieves and burglars away:     Participate in Neighborhood Watch programs or work with police to organize your own if there isn't one in your neighborhood.     Install a peep hole or door viewer in your front door so visitors can be easily seen.     Install deadbolts on exterior doors and doors that connect garages with your house.     Secure sliding glass doors, which are an easy target for entry.     Don't be intimidated by gang members or others who use scare tactics to threaten witnesses not to testify.

Officers note surge in gang-related crime,Terri Vermeulen,Anaheim Bulletin,english,"Saddled with the county's second largest population of gangs, Anaheim police told residents they are becoming increasingly burdened with calls of gang-related crimes. In a neighborhood crime prevention forum sponsored by Assemblyman Tom Umberg, D-Garden Grove, investigators told residents that they have identified between 35 and 40 gangs active in the city. ""The numbers are growing, particularly in Anaheim,"" said Mike Aquino, gang prevention investigator. ""Right now, we're overburdened and the problems are getting worse."" Anaheim is believed to have the second largest population of gang members     about 900. Only Santa Ana appears to have the highest number of gang members, Aquino said. The numbers don't include gang members who come from outside the city, many of whom are associated with Los Angeles gangs, Aquino said. Police formed the gang prevention unit early last year after noticing an upsurge in gang activity. The unit has made about 400 arrests, Aquino said. Parents can take the first step in keeping their children out of gangs, he said. Often, parents don't know what their children are doing and are shocked to learn that they are involved with gangs, Aquino a""Keep in tune with your kids and know who their friends are,"" he advised parents.

Group gambles on casino night to fund mobile command center for emergencies,Terri Vermeuien,Anaheim Bulletin,english,"Ed Finney believes the city deserves a state-of-the-art mobile command center ready for emergencies. But all the city has is a converted ambulance that's clearly insufficient to deal with crises such as hostage situations. Police Chief Joseph Molloy said. So, Fimiey and the Anaheim Police Officers Honorary's Association, a group of local business executives, have decided to do something to change it. They're coordinating a casino night, which will be held Sept. 25 at the Jolly Roger at 640 W. Katella! Ave. They know they're not going to raise the thousands of dollars it will take to equip the center with state-of-the-art equipment during a single casino night, Finney said. ""If we were to make $4,000 or $5,000, we'd think we had died and gone to heaven,"" Finney said."" But this is a start. We're hoping that we're pushing the council, the mayor and even businesses- ...We're hoping to make the city fathers feel a little guilty."" During crisis situations, the converted ambulance has made police   operations difficult. It doesn't ensure privacy and""difficult at best,"" Molloy said. The old ambulance will soon be exchanged for one of the city's used Bookmobiles, which will better serve the department's needs. But the police department still is counting on fund-raisers, such as the association's, to fill the gaps left by scanty city budgets, Molloy said. In the past, the association has provided funds for police officers' widows and orphans and awarded scholarships to police officers' children. ""We're a group of businessmen who feel that police officers do a good job,"" Finney said. ""I think it's a shame that a city this size doesn't have a state-of-the-art system.""",1992,06-Aug
"Disagreements, opinions welcomed and encouraged",Don J. Clever,Anaheim Bulletin,english,"Long an advocate of libertarianism, I have often been challenged by readers to present my precise editorial position on social government. I also have been demeaned, vilified and ostracized by some who vehemently disagree with my arguments for individual self-reliance and against the force of governmental collectiveness. As editorial and community director of the North County News, I sit as a member of an editorial board which determines content of the editorial opinions of this newspapers so what follows is written from the vievipoint of the editorial board. We do hear from supporters of the libertarian philosophy or from those who believe it is time for government to shrink its tentacles in deference to personal liberties. But in the main it is generally the folks who wish to debate our stance on the issues who are apt to let us hear about the errors of our ways. This is good. After all, the editorial opinion expressed on this page each week is offeied as a means to get readers to think about what it is that government really does for us. The opinions expressed on this page by the editorial board basically espouse the philosophy of the late R.C. Hoiles, founder of Freedom Newspapers Inc., parent company of Golden West Publishing, which publishes this newspaper. That philosophy is presented only on this, the editorial page, and not in our regular news columns. Mr. Hoiles believed that each individual was born with certain rights, derived from the Creator of Nature and that these rights may not be rightfully taken from that individual by anyone. These rights include the right to take action to defend life, liberty and any property, honestly acquired during the course of one's life. He believed that an individual has the right to join with others in defense of these individual rights; at the same time being constrained from aggressive actions which deprive others of these same rights. He refused to recognize that political government, as opposed by self-government, is a proper means to attain one's objectives. Political government entails the use of aggressive force in organization, financing and execution, according to Mr. Hoiles. Today, we echo that philosophy. Our real hope is to encourage others to be strong, self-reliant and responsible. While we use this page to present these philosophical viewpoints, the page is by no means our property alone. It is for the use of our readers, too. Some of you, perhaps, are opinionated and need a forum for your opinions. We offer this space for letters to the editor.

Ex-parks superintendent crowned anti-gang czar,Brett Sporich,Anaheim Bulletin,english,"Steve Swaim, Anaheim   s new anti-gang and drug czar, on Monday began helping residents cope with gang influences and drug sales that have flooded the streets of several neighborhoods. Swaim, a former Parks, Recreation and Community Services Department superintendent, was appointed to the post shortly after religious leaders from the Orange County Congregation Community Organization packed City Council meetings with hundreds of their followers. Religious and community leaders are calling for the city to fund a recently adopted policy designed by a citizen   s advisory committee called the Gang-Drug Task Force. Swaim   s task is to coordinate volunteer and government organizations to better utilize programs that are available but underused.

Request for nude cabaret struck down a second time,David Heitz,Anaheim Bulletin,english,"When it comes to entertainment, the magic of Disneyland or the excitment of a professional baseball, football or hockey game is more acceptable to city leaders than the erotica of a nude cabaret. Amer ElRousan's request to open a non-alcoholic juice and soda bar, where women would peel off all of their clothes and dance for patrons, was denied Tuesday by the City Council. The Planning Commission had rejected his plans three weeks ago. Santa Monica attorney Roger Diamond, who has represented clients for 26 years in support of First Amendment issues, said he likely will file a lawsuit against the city in Orange County Superior Court or a federal district court to appeal the decision. ""I'm disappointed, but not surprised,"" Diamond said after the council unanimously voted against granting the Sahara Theater at 1210 S. State College Blvd. a conditional use permit for nude dancing. Councilman Fred Hunter was absent. ""When dealing with businesses protected by the First Amendment, there's such a potential for denial based on religious and moral grounds. The court has said that cities can't exercise discretion based on this."" Diamond said he often sees elected officials circumvent the law for the sake of public opinion. About 75 people attended the council meeting to oppose the cabaret, and at least 20 of them spoke at the public hearing, which lasted almost three hours. Neighbors presented the council with a petition signed by 600 people who don't want men who enjoy watching nude dancing roaming around their neighborhood. ""I can only imagine if you've been in there two or three hours watching young ladies jump up and down in the nude what might be on your mind when you come out,"" said Richard Gubler, a dentist whose office is located near the cabaret site. He echoed the concerns of other business owners, clergy members and parents who feared the business would bring prostitution and other crimes to the area. Nobody spoke in support of the proposed cabaret besides El-Rousan and Diamond. Anaheim adopted a strict ordinance earlier this year that states adult entertainment businesses may not be located within 1,000 feet of a school, church or park, or 400 feet from a residential neighborhood. Rousan's proposed cabaret meets those criteria. The municipal code also regulates the businesses will not ""adversely affect"" adjoining land uses. Diamond said judges in federal courtrooms have ruled against cities that ban adult spots from opening unless they violate a land use. He said that when a city denies a permit, it must do so based on objective information and not moral beliefs. Diamond filed a lawsuit in Orange County Superior Court in December 1992, challenging Anaheim's previous adult ordinance. He said that ordinance allowed the city to turn down a request for an adult business based on subjective considerations. Three weeks before the issue was supposed to go to court, Anaheim changed its law and removed the inclusion of subjective evidence as criteria in deciding to issue a permit, Diamond said. When the councilmen denied the request Tuesday, most of them admitted they did so on personal grounds. ""I think it's a slimy operation,"" Councilman Irv Pickler said. ""It's in the gutter. If it's going to have to go to court, it goes to court."" ""I'm old-fashioned,"" Councilman Frank Feldhaus said, "" and I'm not going to support it. I just assume we battle it out in the courts with the feds."" Councilman Bob Simpson said he doubts the framers of the Constitution ever dreamed that people would use the First Amendment to defend the existence of nude cabarets.

Request for nude cabaret struck down a second time,David Heitz,Anaheim Bulletin,english,"When it comes to entertainment, the magic of Disneyland or the excitment of a professional baseball, football or hockey game is more acceptable to city leaders than the erotica of a nude cabaret. Amer ElRousan's request to open a non-alcoholic juice and soda bar, where women would peel off all of their clothes and dance for patrons, was denied Tuesday by the City Council. The Planning Commission had rejected his plans three weeks ago. Santa Monica attorney Roger Diamond, who has represented clients for 26 years in support of First Amendment issues, said he likely will file a lawsuit against the city in Orange County Superior Court or a federal district court to appeal the decision. ""I'm disappointed, but not surprised,"" Diamond said after the council unanimously voted against granting the Sahara Theater at 1210 S. State College Blvd. a conditional use permit for nude dancing. Councilman Fred Hunter was absent. ""When dealing with businesses protected by the First Amendment, there's such a potential for denial based on religious and moral grounds. The court has said that cities can't exercise discretion based on this."" Diamond said he often sees elected officials circumvent the law for the sake of public opinion. About 75 people attended the council meeting to oppose the cabaret, and at least 20 of them spoke at the public hearing, which lasted almost three hours. Neighbors presented the council with a petition signed by 600 people who don't want men who enjoy watching nude dancing roaming around their neighborhood. ""I can only imagine if you've been in there two or three hours watching young ladies jump up and down in the nude what might be on your mind when you come out,"" said Richard Gubler, a dentist whose office is located near the cabaret site. He echoed the concerns of other business owners, clergy members and parents who feared the business would bring prostitution and other crimes to the area.

Officials hiope to snag $2 miliion for youth jobs,David Heitz,Anaheim Bulletin,english,"The city's Job Training Partnership Act office will help 1,000 disadvantaged youth find jobs this summer if President Clinton's economic stimulus package is approved by Congress. More than $2 million has been allocated by the Clinton administration for Anaheim's Summer Youth Employment Program, JTPA representative Daizel Cortez said. ""We're really getting geared up for this,"" Cortez said. ""Last year we got $1 million, which included additional funding that we received because of the (Los Angeles) riots."" A product of the Reagan administration, the jobs act was passed by Congress in 1982. The bill, cosponsored by Ted Kennedy and former senator and vice-president Dan Quayle, formed a partnership between government and private industry to make low-income youth ages 14 to 21 more employable. To qualify for JTPA, youth must meet certain incomeguidlines, lack math or reading skills or have a handicap. The program, a partnership between JTPA and the Anaheim Private Industry Council, also promotes staying in school and assists in remedial education, career development and the job search. Claudia Rios, 19, said JTPA offered her the only support she could find after she had a baby at IS. ""I finished 10th grade and then stayed home with my baby for about two years,"" she said. ""I wanted to go back to school at the Trident Center, but I couldn't pay for a babysitter. "" I went back to JTPA and they kind of helped me find a job again     and paid for my child"" These days, Rios attends Fullerton College where she is learning to be a paralegal. She also works in the human resources department of Clothestime headquarters. ""They helped me a lot,"" she said. Mel Miller, chairman of the private industry council, said the summer program helps local businesses, too. ""The PIC programs supply business with resources and incentives to make a much needed investment in human capital,"" he said. ""This is a win-win partnership between the PIC, its participants and the business community in Anaheim."" The $2.2 million would be used to subsidize the salaries of JTPA employees, who work in various industries at businesses throughout Anaheim. While the employers get free manpower, the employee gets work experience, job skills and the chance for a good future reference. ""The job training program has been very helpful to us from a small business perspective,"" employer Marilyn Leuer said. She owns Power Property Services in Anaheim Hills. She said her company has employed several teens through JTP",1993,22-Apr
Olympic swimmer offers glimpse into what motivates her,Anne M. Peterson,Anaheim Bulletin,english,"All Janet Evans wanted to do after coming home with three gold medals from the 1988 Olympics was see her boyfriend and hang out with her friends. Not many high school students know that, but a select group of 474 Western High School teens heard Evans' story last week as she discussed motivation and what pushed her to do her best in the 1988 and 1992 Olympics. The students who heard Evans' pep talk received a barbecue lunch and special certificates for having grade point averages of 3.0 and above. Evans, an El Dorado High School graduate from Placentia, took home her fourth gold medal and silver her first from Barcelona last summer. Evans' high school years weren't like those of typical 17- year-olds, she said. Since the seventh grade, she would rise at 4:30 a.m., swim from 5 to 7 a.m., go to school and then swim again from 2 to 6 p.m. ""I did OK in school,"" the 21- year-old Evans said. ""Swimming took so much of my time. It made me more disciplined. I had no social life."" Western Principal Warren Stephenson helped organize the event aimed at motivating students. Stephenson said the motivation al speakers series began last year. In order to encourage students to excel, Western High offers an academic letter, much like an athlete's letter, to students who maintain a minimum 3.5 CPA for three semesters. ""It's exactly the same thing as a sports letter,"" Warrenson said. ""We're the first school in Anaheim Union High School District to have these. Instead of a football or baseball, we have these."" The academic letters feature an open book and feather pen instead of a piece of sports equipment. Evans, now a communications major at USC, said she wants to finish college and find a job in a public relations field.",1993,22-Apr

Thoughtful debate will determine future of Disney resort,Johnw Swanson,Anaheim Bulletin,english,"Wednesday is shaping up as a big day in Anaheim. That's the day the Planning Commission will hold its first hearings on the proposed Disneyland Resort project. Since last year's announcement that the Walt Disney Co. was going to focus its efforts on whether to proceed with the S3 billion Anaheim plan, the debate has been bubbling just below the surface. Expansion proponents call the Disney plan a much-needed boost that will pave the way to the future not only for the amusement park but for the city as well. Its detractors, however, focus on the myriad problems they say aren't adequately addressed     or are ignored     in the initial environmental reports and the subsequent response to criticisms. It is against this backdrop that the Disneyland project will receive its first full-fledged public hearing, with all sides coming together for what promises to be a lengthy debate. To accommodate an expected healthy turnout, city officials have scheduled this hearing at 1:30 p.m. Wednesday in the Park Pl of the Inn at the Park hotel. 1855 S. Harbor Blvd. Given the concerns expressed JOHNW. SWANSON by officials from local school districts and neighboring cities, given the concerns of the park's neighbors and given the concerns of what this project ultimately will cost the city, I hope people do turn out. Such first-hand involvement is vital ill a project this big, the likes of which this city hasn't seen since Disneyland originally was built in the 1950s. Then, however, Anaheim was a completely different city     one that didn't include a thriving Convention Center across the street or a stadium and arena a couple of miles away. Some people at the time even doubted that Disneyland would succeed, much less spawn the dramatic growth that followed in the next two decades. Today, it's a different story. The city's flatJands, in most people's eyes, already are pretty much built out     something that isn't lost on Disney officials. To their credit, they realize that building this project in an urban enesents a different set of challenges than they would face if they were starting from scratch in an undeveloped location. But overcoming those challenges to the satisfaction of most people     no matter what is done, it won't please everyone     is easier said than done, especially since many of those problems need to be addressed even if this project doesn't go forward. In Disney's eyes, however, those problems     including traffic flow and structural improvements the area long has needed     are solvable. Disney officials also believe the monetary questions, including a possible $ 1 billion commitment by the city, aren't insurmountable. ' What ultimately may kill the project is widespread public opposition that would make it impossible for city officials to approve the necessary permits required for the project to move forward. That's why Wednesday's hearng is so important. For those who oppose the Disney expansion for whatever reason, it represents an opportunity to have their viewsthemselves how city and Disney officials respond to their concerns. For those who have yet to make up their minds, it represents an opportunity to hear firsthand the divergent opinions on this major project. And, for all of us who live and work in Anaheim, it represents the first step on the long road that ultimately will shape the city's future, no matter what becomes of the Disneyland Resort. Given what's at stake, I urge those who participate in Wednesday's hearing to do so with decorum and understanding and not turn it into the political circus that marred the 1991 budget hearings. The issue is too important, the stakes are too high. Only through informed, thoughtful debate will the people of this city be able to decide for themselves if the Disneyland Resort should be part of our future.",1993,22-Apr
Professionals taking classes on environment,Anne M. Peterson,Anaheim Bulletin,english,"As a certified public accountant, Cindy Nickerson realized there was something missing in her career.

Area colleges and universities are reporting an increase in students interested in studying society and the environment. Students groups such as the Rainforest Action Group at Chapman University and new chapters of Greenpeace and the Sierra Club at local colleges sprout every year. Two years ago, Cal State Fullerton didn't have an Environmental Studies Program, but because of demand, it now offers a master's degree in the field. Students from just about every background enroll in the program, said Dennis Berg, Cal State Fullerton's coordinator of Environmental Studies. ""It's rich with people with different expertises,"" he said. ""We have a fairly broad perspective of all environmental concerns. Every day of the year, I get a call from a new student interested in the program. "" Berg said half of the graduate students already work in an environmental field yet go back to school to receive more training to advance at their jobs. ""Everywhere you turn there are increased amounts of environmental regulations and I think an increased awareness,"" he said. ""We can't continue to do the things we did in the past."" Governmental agencies as well as private industry are more often hiring environmental consultants. For example, developers and cities must hire geologists to determine if land is stable for housing. Consultants specializing in hazardous waste are often hired by businesses that use or emit chemical byproducts. Chapman University's Environmental Sciences department is a growing one.",1993,22-Apr

Euclid is most complained about street in city,Lisa O'Neil,Anaheim Bulletin,english,"Euclid Street has drawn the most complaints from Anaheim residents who have called a hotline to complain about too many red lights on the county's streets. The Orange County Transportation Authority has received about 25 calls about Anaheim streets and intersections on a hotline set up to gather complaints about the poor coordination of traffic signals, said OCTA spokesman John Standiford. The most calls in Anaheim have been about Euclid Street, north of Lincoln Avenue, he said. Those callers complain that they always have to stop at every light, Standiford said. OCTA also has received calls about the intersection of Katella Avenue and State College Boulevard and about Orangethorpe Avenue, east of Rose Street. John Lower, the city's traffic and transportation manager, said there are a number of closely spaced signals on Euclid from the Riverside (91) Freeway to Lincoln Avenue. ""That area is going to improve with the widening of the 1-5,"" he said. ""A lot of people I know are frustrated with (the area),"" Lower said. Lower said that the traffic on Katella and State College changes by the hour, time and day of the week. Events at Anaheim Stadium often create traffic jams at the intersection. But a 1991 traffic study showed that the intersection offered an ""acceptable level of service,"" Lower said. Lower said that residents should avoid the area when there are events at Anaheim Stadium. Signals on Orangethorpe Avenue will be coordinated with the help of Measure M, the county's half-cent transportation sales tax, he said. The city of Fullerton will work to improve the coordination of traffic signals on Orangethorpe. OCTA has received more than 300 calls since beginning the hotline before Thanskgiving.

GASTON: 28-year veteran becomes chief,Lisa O'Neill,Anaheim Bulletin,english,"But Gaston is a self-described optimist. ""We have in the department some very dedicated and talented individuals,"" he said. ""The Anaheim Police Department is . Viewed as a good place to work and a good department to be a part of."" Gaston believes the contract dispute is close to a resolution. ""I think the gap is closing in terms of the disagreement,"" he said. ""We're very close to coming to a resolution of the contract and with the pay adjustment we will be more competitive in the field."" Like former Chief Joseph T. Molloy, who died of a heart attack in July, Gaston said he will maintain a high profile in the department. ""I'm not someone who really likes to be captive inside my office any more than I have to be,"" he said. ""The chief is a coach and is somebody who should be out in close contact with what's going on in the department and should make himself available to the community."" Gaston should know; he has worked with six police chiefs. ""There are parts of me that are influenced by all six;"" Gaston said. ""I enjoy moving around the organization and I know that (Molloy) did, too. To us, police work is fun. It's serious business but we still get a great deal of enjoyment out of it."" Gaston's role model is former Police Chief Mark A. Stephenson, the chief who hired him and after whom the station is named. ""He was a father figure for the guys that worked here. He was a stabilizing influence,"" Gaston said. ""There was no question in our minds as to who the chief was and what his values were and what he expected of the members of the department. He was a role model because he practiced what he preached and so whatever his expectation was of the department he exemplified that in his own life."" Gaston was chosen from a field of 40 candidates presented to City Manager Jim Ruth by anexecutive search firm. Ruth said there were many factors leading to Gaston's appointment. ""(Gaston) has tremendous experience and background in law enforcement. He has knowledge of the departments, has worked in almost every department and is knowledgeable about the problems facing Anaheim,"" he said. In his 28 years on the force, Gaston has been a patrol officer, motorcycle officer, accident investigator and detective. He was promoted to the rank of captain in 1983 and oversaw the department's gang, narcotics and vice details. Gaston's roots are local. He graduated from Bellflower High School in 1962. He joined the force in 1965, three years into his studies at California State University, Long Beach, where he was an education major. He changed his major to criminology. ""My impulse was always to be a police officer,"" he said. Gaston also has a master's degree in public administration from USC. A resident of Anaheim for 28 years, Gaston is married to Linda Gaston, a specialist in teaching hearing-impaired students for Anaheim Union High School District. Gaston has four children, three from a former marriage and one with Linda. He enjoys gardening, running, bicycling and reading, especially history and biographies. He currently is reading a biography of Harry Truman. Gaston is also involved with the Sunkist Baptist Church. Gaston has seen many changes in his 28 years on the force. Anaheim's population has grown tremendously, he said. The density of the city has changed in many areas. Anaheim is now a 24-hour city. ""At one time the city was relatively quiet in the hours of the morning,"" Gaston said. ""That's not the case now."" There are more calls for service because there's a greater reliance placed on the Police Department, Gaston said. And, although there has been a percapita decrease in crime, violent crimes have increased, he said. Gaston said the department is entering into reorganization, which will change the department only from an administrative standpoint. The department currently has five divisions and will, soon have four. The change will cut administrative overhead costs, Gaston said. He also intends to expand community-based policing. ""We've had some noticeable successes in the past,"" Gaston said. ""We have what we think is a working formula as to how to move into an area with the cooperation of the residents."" Gaston said that gangs and drugs are major problems that must be addressed. ""We need to deal with the problems associated with narcotics and drugs in not only sales on the streets but impact they're having on people's lives and in the community,"" Gaston said. ""We need to have a very noticeable presence on the street."" In April, the department will get some help in fighting gangs. A deputy district attorney, a deputy district attorney investigator and a probation officer will work with two police gang investigators to combat gang activity. It's a program modeled after a TARGET team in Westminster. The team will target gang leaders who seem to be instrumental in causing gangs to grow and become involved in criminal activity, Gaston said. They will also focus on individuals who are on probation because of previous offenses. ",1994,13-Jan
Billiard center's entertainment plan nixed,Lisa O'Neill,Anaheim Bulletin,english,"Allen David Ornstein, a partner in the Electric Circus on Beach Blvd., asked Planning Commissioners on Monday to allow him to have live entertainment in his billiard center. Ornstein said that business is slow and that he needs live entertainment to keep his doors open. His partner has already mortgaged his house, he said. ""For certain, if I don't have entertainment, my doors will shut,"" Ornstein said. He said he didn't understand why he was not allowed to have a permit for entertainment. ""We're talking about a entertainment permit here. I'm not looking for a permit to build a nuclear bomb,"" Ornstein said. Commissioner Mitch Caldwell said that the spirit of what Ornstein was asking for differs from what the commission originally approved. ""It's like comparing rock and roll to classical,"" Caldwell said. ""I'm going to vote to deny and ask you to come back with a new conditional use permit."" But Ornstein protested, saying he couldn't afford to wait. Commissioners voted 6-1 to deny Ornstein's request but suggested he obtain a special events permit, which would allow him to offer live entertainment . In other action, commissioners voted to allow two brothers to build a 3,700-square foot baseball school on a 2.35 acre lot on La Palm a Avenue. Mike and Steve Kiefer will construct a facility with four batting cages     three for hitting and one for pitching. There will be one instructor with one student per half-hour session, Mike Kiefer said. The property is within a 3,700- square foot industrial building.

Celebrating 'Double Chai',Lisa O'Neill,Anaheim Bulletin,english,"When Ruth Notkin first became involved in the Temple Beth Emet, members met in a carpenters union hall and a Methodist Church and held High Holy days services at a women's club in Garden Grove. Notkin, who is from New York, said most of the people involved at the time were from the East Coast. ""There was a warm feeling because most of us did not have much family in the area,"" she said. ""We were each other's families."" Members then bought a small house on Emily Street and began meeting there. It wasn't until 1963 that the congregation moved to its present five-acre location on Cerritos Avenue. Orange County's first conservative synagogue, Temple Beth Emet is now celebrating it's ""Double Chai"" or 36th anniversary. Chai is Hebrew for 18 and means life and good luck. As part of the celebration, 36 trees will be planted in Israel. The temple is asking that no individual member contribute more than $1. The temple has 22 founding families who are still active. Notkin is one of the 22. So is Shirley Berko, the temple's first woman president. Berko, president from 1980-82, said she's seen many changes in the more than 36 years she's been with Temple Beth Emet. ""When we first started, women were just here. We didn't participate,"" said Berko, 59. ""Now, we have full participation."" Berko, who was the first woman to hold the Torah at a High Holy day service at the temple, considers the congregation her extended family. ""It's a major part of my life,"" she said.

Teen to be ambassador for muscular dystrophy group,Lisa O'Neill,Anaheim Bulletin,english,"Scott Miller first met his hero Jerry Lewis at the Muscular Dystrophy Assn. telethon in Las Vegas. Now, the two are fast friends. Lewis calls Miller; Miller has Lewis' home telephone number and the number on his boat. For the next year, Miller, 13, will have an opportunity to do more than just call his friend on the phone. He will attend special events and work with Lewis as the junior goodwill ambassador for the association's Orange County chapter. Miller says he will be at the events to help ""Jerry."" Miller's mom Linda, who is executive secretary for the Orange County chapter, said this year is probably the best year for her ""son to be goodwill ambassador. ""He's been with Jerry, "" she said. ""And he knows what it's all about."" When he was 4 years old, Scott was diagnosed with Duchenne muscular dystrophy, one of the more progressive neuromuscular diseases, which occurs primarily in boys. Linda Miller said she and husband, John, didn't recognize that Scott was doing some things at a slower rate than other children'. ""I didn't have any other childrento compare him with,"" she said. He didn't walk until he was 18 months and he seemed to tire easily, but everything else was right on target. Now, she says she can spot a child with Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy ""from a mile off."" Muscular dystrophy may have slowed Scott down a bit, but it doesn't stop him from enjoying his hobbies. He collects trolls and dinosaurs, and he loves to make banners on his computer and print them out for special occasions. He also has a rabbit named Capt. Rabbit, a tribute to one of his pals at the Anaheim Fire Department. Scott's other honors include a uniform and badge issued by the fire department in 1987. He is Anaheim's only honorary firefighter. Fire Chief Jeff Bowman wrote a two-page letter to the association telling them why Scott should be goodwill ambassador.

Simpson is just another politician,John W Swanson,Anaheim Bulletin,english,"Bob Simpson doesn't like being called a politician. The former city manager turned councilman says politics isn't his game because, simply, he's ""too blunt, too outspoken"" to be one. ""Politics isn't my forte,"" Simpson said in a recent interview. ""I wish there were no politicians."" Despite his protestations to the contrary, Simpson is playing the political game. His recent talk that he's considering a race for mayor this November is nothing more than politics, pure and simple. And, those statements     coupled with his hard-hitting 1990 election campaign     hardly give credence to his self-proclaimed hatred of politics, even though it is possible to run for election as an anti-politician if you don't allow yourself to be caught up in politics for politics' sake. Being a politician has gotten a bad rap of late. True, the game-playing that those in office at every level of government resort to simply to be re-elected can be nauseating. But it doesn't have to be that way. Politics can be honorable, if those engaged in it put their integrity above their own selfish interests. At one time, that was Simpson's goal. So when I hear someone decry politics and politicians at the same time he's playing his own Cuomo-esquepolitical game of publicly gauging support for a possible mayor, I consider it nothing more than just another political ploy, especially when there's a record to fall back on. That's certainly true in Simpson's case. Shortly after his election in 1990, after a bare-knuckles, noholds-barred campaign, Simpson said he was only going to be a one-term councilman At the time, he cited his hatred of politics and his desire to retire away from Anaheim. With those retirement plans apparently on hold, at least for the time being, Simpson now finds himself having to cope with those oft-repeated statements as he considers running for mayor. It is interesting, as well, that Simpson's comments focus solely on the mayor's seat     a remarkable feat of linguistic legerde main. If he runs this year, he said, he won't seek re-election to the CityCouncil. His only interest, he said, is running for mayor. But let's examine the realities. First, the mayor in this town is but one member of the City Council. While the mayor's job is the council's most visible and carries with it some cerl duties, the mayor carries no more pull on the council than any other council member. If the mayor doesn't have two other votes on any proposed action or appointment, it goes down in flames. All Simpson need do is ask council ally Fred Hunter about that. Second, running for mayor really is no different than running for City Council. According to changes in the City Charter voters approved in 1990, this will be the first time any eligible Anaheim resident can run for mayor without being a sitting City Council member first. Throughout the 1980s, the mayor had been chosen every two years at the ballot box. But, the charter     the document that spells out the city's powers and those of its leaders     restricted mayoral candidates to sitting council members. That led to instances during which some mayoral hopefuls had to run two campaigns at once     one for re-election to the council, the other for election, or re-election, as mayor. The charter revisions changed all that by setting aside one seat for the mayor. Even though someone is a declared candidate for mayor, that candidate really is running for the City Council.",1994,13-Jan

Prescription for a healthy economy for California business,Richard J Stegemeier,Anaheim Bulletin,english,"For California business, a top priority in 1994 must be to continue purefforts to create more jobs and improve the business climate. Our calls for change were finally heard in 1993. Legislation was enacted to address some of the most pressing problems, including workers' compensation reform, the tax climate and regulatory red tape. Our prescription for a healthy California economy includes the following nine elements: To solve the state's ongoing budget gap, we must nordelay , or water down the tax incentives passed last year or resort to new taxes or fees to covertfaef shortfall. We made progress in streamlining regulations in 1993, but further reforms are needed to eliminate conflicting, overlapping and duplicative rules. In particular, action is needed to reduce the burden of the cumbersome California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) processes and prevent them fromblocking vital business activities. Tort reform is absolutely necessary in California. Our liability laws encourage costly and unnecessacy litigation. The proposed state ergonomics standard cannot be implementedasdrafted. Its numerous requirements are overly burden some, especially for small business, and in many fases, are backed by hard scientific evidence. The state's infrastructure, including transportation and water delivery systems, needs attention now to ensure it can support the demands of a growing population. We need a positive marketing program to emphasize what's right about California. Our agenda includes no quick fixes or painless remedies.",1994,13-Jan
Quake also shatters people's complacency,John W Swanson,Anaheim Bulletin,english,"The earthquake that rocked Southern California early Monday morning is yet another reminder of just how fragile life here can be. The early hour of the temblor that measured 6.6 on the Richter scale undoubtedly spared many lives of people who otherwise might have been on or near the sections of freeway that collapsed in the San Fernando Valley. While Orange County did experience some quake-related damage, the worst damage may have been to people's complacency. I know that's true with me. When I was jolted awake shortly after 4:30 Monday morning, I reacted pretty much as I do during a quake. I made sure I was in a place of relative safety and waited until things stopped rocking. The power stayed on and, fortunately, I have no gas lines to worry about. I did a quick look around my apartment and everything was in place     although some of the open doors were more ajar than open. I then returned to bed and quickly fell back to sleep. When the radio clicked on later that morning, I began hearing news reportt freeway collapses, buildings ablaze and the other tragedies that accompanied this quake. I bolted from bed and turned on the television and began seeing the devastation. My first thoughts went out to those who either were killed or injured in the quake and then to those whose lives have been spared but who lost everything else. As I was trying-to get a feel for what had happened throughout the San Fernando Valley and other parts of Los Angeles, I heard a spokeswoman from the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power advising its customers to boil their water for 20 minutes before using it as a safety precaution. That's when my complacency was shattered. Having lived in Southern California all of my life, I have experienced several major quakes. I've seen the pictures and read the reports of collapsed buildings, disrupted services and the like while television newscasters recite the litany of precautions people can take to be sure they're prepared in case disaster strikes. The only preparations I have made, however, is making sure my renter's insurance policy covers earthquake damage and making sure a somewhat powerful flashlight that also has an attached battery-operated radio in case of emergency works. I know that works because I replaced the batteries shortly after a power outage a couple of weeks ago. However, I must admit that the flashlight is courtesy of my mother, who gave it to me after the Whittier earthquake a few years back. But, I have none of the water or food supplies that disaster specialists recommend you have on hand in case of an emergency. And, my supply of readily available first-aid material is also - rather skimpy. When I went back to sleep Monday morning after the quake was over, I realized that it was a bad one. But, I didn't give any thought to the possibility that there would be the type of destruction that filled my television screen when I woke again later that morning. I thought, rather naively, that everything would be OK. Sure, there'd be some shattered windows, grocery stores would be littered with scattered food and broken glass and some buildings would have cracks that weren't there before the quake hit. It would be, as far as I knew, just a typical earthquake. Sadly, it didn't turn out that way. As I got ready to come to work Monday morning, I started making a mental list of all those things that people say you should have available in case of an emergency. I even pulled out the telephone book and turned it to the page (in my phone book, it's page B9 in the front before the alphabetical listings) that includes a basic list of emergency supplies you should have on hand. This time, I'm promising myself, I'm going to make sure that I have all the things that I should have     that I've known for years I should have     in case the next quake damages more than just my c",1994,13-Jan
"Police call move way to clean up area, cut crime",Michael Easterbrook,Anaheim Bulletin,english,"Property owners welcome a Police Department plan to ban street parking in the LeatriceWakefield area, but residents there say the proposal would leave them no p ace to park. The preliminary proposal by the Anaheim Police Department's community policing team would ban all street parking on Wakefield Avenue, Leatrice Lane, Pearson Avenue, Sprague Lane and Mountain view Avenue. Police say the ban will reduce drug dealing conducted behind the line of cars that shield dealers from passersby, force residents to clean out apartment garages that have become dumping grounds for dilapidated cars, mattresses and trash and trelieve overcrowding in these densly populated apartments. With only one garage per apartment, the number of tenants living in each apartment will be reduced, police say. The champions of the program, Officers Harald Martin and Ed Cook, met with property owners and residents on separate occasions. At a Jan. 17 meeting with apartment owners, 29 owners said they support the ban while six opposed. At a meeting with tenants two days later, 19 said they opposed the ban, while eight supported it. ""Where are we going to park our cars?"" said resident Maggie Aquilar. ""We only get one garage per apartment. They'll give us tickets but we'll protest them,"" she said. But Martin said the ban is needed because the line of cars hides illegal activity. ""Cars cut down on visibility,"" Martin said. ""They can see us but we can't see them. When there are no cars on the streets we have un impeded visibility,"" he said. Police say overcrowding also contributes to the problem. It's not unusual, they say, to find 10 family members sharing a four bedroom apartment. Aguilar's family is typical. Aguilar shares her apartment with her husband, son, father-in law and sister. The six-member family owns five cars with just one, one-car garage. The rest of the cars are parked on the street, she said. The parking ban would force Aguilar's family to either sell four cars or rent other apartments to acquire more parking spaces. Although 380 parking spaces will be eliminated, police say more than 240 will be created by hauling out junk in garages and paving over grass lots to create additional outdoor parking lots. Police say the ban is needed because they respond to an average 1,079 calls a year in the area com posed of about 100 apartment buildings. That makes it the costliest neigh From October 1993 to October 1994, the department spent $494,163    more than 1 percent of its budget     on the area. Police say the mhe crimes involve gang-related activity such as drug-dealing, car theft and graffiti vandalism. While police are confident it will reduce crime, street vendors say the parking ban will also hurt their business. Vendors say the ban would pre vent them from selling goods in the neighborhood     a service some residents rel""I don't think it's that helpful,"" said vendor Jerry Reyes. ""Sales go down, clientile gets upset."" Reyes is one of six vendors who sell items you'll find in any convenience store such as fruits, vegetables and dried goods. Some property owners have been trying, unsuccessfully, to get the     city to ban street vendors throughout the city, saying the vendors and their patrons leave trash in their wake, hide drug deals and harm business at local markets and convenience stores. City offi""responded by limiting the length of time vendors can park in any one area     a restriction that vendor opponents say is easily circumvented. Despite the opposition, police say the ban is the best solution. 'This is an approach that manipulates the enviro"" Cook said. ""We can't just address these problems by throwing money at them"" Police say if the parking ban is approved by the Planning Commission and the City Council, it will reduce crime by 30 percent to 50 percent.",1995,02-Feb

Businesses still optimistic about Disney plans,Michael Easterbrook,Anaheim Bulletin,english,"Local business people are optimistic that a trimmed-down Westcot development will boost a faltering tourist industry. Walt Disney Co. officials announced Monday they will not renew their options to purchase six parcels of land around Disneyland that would have been used for the originally planned $3 billion expansion. Plans to build a scaled-down version of Westcot will materialize by the end of the year, officials said., Disney .announced the Westcot project in 1991. They said it would require 4,600 more hotel rooms, bring 27,900 more jobs to the area and generate $56 million in new taxes and fees to Anaheim and the county. Here's what business people working in the area said about Disney's latest announcement: Alan Jeffrey, general manager for Candy Cane Inn: ""I think whatever Disney does in Anaheim has my support. Any improvements that they do we'll benefit from it. I had hoped that Westcot would have been done, but whatever they do at least things are happening."" Sterling Wychgel, owner of One Hour Color Prints: ""I never personally thought it was going to go through but any type of expansion will help business."" Mike Kashey, cab driver for Yellow Cab Co.: ""It should be good for business. Business has been good but it can always get better."" Leslie Ooi, owner of the T-Shirt Shop: ""I believe it could be good for business but on the other hand it could also be worse. They're going to build a lot more stores inside the park and Disney wants everyone to spend money inside.""     Thad Anders, general manager for Zaby's Motor L""We're just wondering how scaled back the project is going to be. We were hoping it was going to be its original version, but Disney always helps business. I think a lot of people were waiting for the new project before they came back.

Sculpture debuts at the Pond,Michael Easterbrook,Anaheim Bulletin,english,"Whether you're a fan of professional wrestling, Barbra Streisand or the Mighty Ducks, ""The Anamorph"" is sure to catch your eye. The Anamorph is a sculpture designed by artists Michael Davis, Ann Preston and Richard Turner that now sits at the southeast corner of the Arrowhead Pond. ""I hope we as artists have got to the point where we can make something recognizable,"" Preston said. ""This is about the coming together of people to make a spectacle of enjoyment,"" she said. An anamorph is a device used to clear up a distorted image. Inside the circular base of the sculpture are ceramic tiles that, when viewed through a mirror, become clear. Turner said ""The Anamorph"" encompasses elements from ancient Greece, renaissance technology and modern psychology. The sculpure is one of a series of works that are part of in the ""Art in Public Places"" project championed by Julie Mayer; Anaheim Arts Council president. ""The Anamorph"" took a year to complete. The concept was first spelled out by a Citizens Advisory Committee, then was turned over to the artists who designed the sculpture and g its construction.

Bingo latest arena in smoking battle,Michael Easterbrook,Anaheim Bulletin,english,"The battle between smokers and non-smokers is now being fought in bingo parlors. Anaheim Union High School District trustees lifted a no-smoking ordinance that nearly put a Katella High School booster club's bingo games out of business and cost the school about $100,000 per year. But what smokers consider a victory angers those who want bingo games smoke free. ""If I go I have to put up with it,"" said Bernice Steffen, a non-smoking bingo player. ""It certainly has been more pleasant without the smoking."" Trustees first considered lifting ban on Jan. 19, but feared doing so would cost the district nearly $3 million a year in federal grant money. A state law enacted on Dec. 26 prohibits smoking on school district property. While districts such a Anaheim Union acted on the law, others allowed smoking to continue during night-time bingo games. Hersh Cherson, president of Katella High School All Sports Boosters, feared the ordinance would drive bingo players to other schools and pot his game out of business. District officials concluded last week that lifting ban wouldn't jeopardize federal grant money as long as no one younger than 18 was present. ""We are pleased that the trustees listened to our plea and gave their approval,"" Cherson said. ""We are not pro-smoking. However, in order to run a bingo game we want to be treated as other school districts are."" But the smokers' victory will be short-lived. After July 1, smoking again will be prohibited because a federal law goes into effect that prohibits using tobacco products on all school district property, regard less of use.",1995,02-Feb

Harry Sherlock is honored for commitment,MARYLAEA,Anaheim Bulletin,english,"Within every community there are those who are sworn to ""Protect and Serve."" This commitment is an awesome responsibility. Within each federal, state, county or city law enforcement agency, there are countless stories of heroism and tales of tremendous sacrifice. The individuals that you don't hear too much about are the ones who quietly go about doing their job, day after day, year after year, to the best of their ability. They go by practically unnoticed by the general public. Once a year in Stanton, Capt. Bob Eason of the Orange County Sheriff's Department, selects one man or woman who has demonstrated consistent and exceptional work to be the recipient of the Deputy of the Year Award. All year long Capt. Eason keeps track of personnel and at the end of the year he makes his decision. Deputy Harry Sherlock was chosen to receive the award this year. Deputy Sherlock has been involved in law enforcement for 30 years; 27 of those years with the Sheriff's Department and the past seven years in Stanton. He is a general crimes investigator, which basically means he is somewhat of a specialist, focusing on a particular aspect of law enforcement. Aside from the skill that is involved in doing police work, Sherlock has also demonstrated excellent conduct within the community and he has a high level of dependability. ""Harry is solid as a rock and can be absolutely depended on,"" Eason said. Somehow, that one statement made me feel safe and secure. Congratulations Deputy Sherlock, and thank you.

Five volunteers are going about their work in the Stanton branch of the Orange County Public Library. The active members of the Friends of Stanton Library, two of whom are in their 70s, spend at least one morning a week covering and patching books, stamping due dates and organizing shelves. But the Friends do more than common, necessary tasks. They also improve the morale of the shrinking staff, funds to the decreasing budget and recognition of all the Stanton branch has to offer. ""They're like a mother to the library,"" Librarian Elke Faraci said of the volunteers. ""They want only the best for the library and the kids (who use it)."" The library support group has been in Stanton for about six years. The once-large group gradually has dwindled to five active members. And it's only been since July, when Faraci began working at the Stanton branch, that the Friends' worth has been fully realized. ""The ages are not young here but what they do, compared to larger libraries, is amazing,"" Faraci said. ""Other groups have 30 or 40 volunteers and three of them do all the work. We only have five volunteers, and they do the work of 30."" Of the active members     Pat Royce, Dorothy Miller, Ballita Schafer, Shirlean Speidel and Joan Montgomery     only Royce lives in Stanton. The others volunteer for various reasons. Miller worked at the library for 15 years and couldn't stay away after she retired. Speidel, who lives in Garden Grove, said her home is right in between two""But you needed me more,"" she said to the other women with a smile. Speidel brings an extra contribution each Christmas. Her sister, Norraine Voegtle, from Rochester, N.Y., comes to visit but spends her stay volunteering at the library. Both help with crafts and decorations. ""For Christmas we had ribbons on everything,"" Faraci said. The Friends make money to support all they do with used-book sales. The money goes to both essential and ""wish list"" items for the library. The group has paid for videos, books, a camera, batteries for emergency flashlights and a coffeemaker. They also give the libary staff morale boosters, such as holiday parties. ""Budgets are being cut severiy so we are completely dependant on the Friends,"" Faraci said. However, their efforts reach beyond library walls into the community. The Friends sponsored a Back to Civic Center Night in the fall and a Chamber of Commerce Mixer in December.

"Stadium's head usher has seen it all, but he really wants baseball to return",Michael Easterbrook,Anaheim Bulletin,english,"Chuck Plumberg will do anything to watch a baseball game. Since 1966, he has worked thousands of hours at sites throughout Anaheim Stadium. He's been a ticket collector and an usher. He's now the head usher. While baseball is his passion, Plumberg's also sat through monster truck pulls, motocross events and Billy Graham revival meetings     one of which filled the stadium to its peak capacity. But it's baseball that he loves     and has since he was a youngster in Kansas City and followed a Triple A team there. This year, however, could be a watershed year for the 70-year old Plumberg, who was recently honored as the stadium's employee o""We didn't anticipate the strike running that long,"" Plumberg said. ""It ruined the playoffs. Baseball has an awful lot of followers ... and they missed that a great deal."" Plumberg took his first parttime job at the stadium the year when it opened in 1966. Like thousands of other Orange County baseball fans, he was drawn to see the Angels play their first game in Anaheim. He was even thrilled when the Rams arrived in 1980 and turned the baseball-only stadium into a dualpurpose sports facility. In their early days here, the Rams drew crowds as large as 62,000. Plumberg thrived on the excitment. ""If you like sports and you like being around people this is a. great job. But baseballls my first love. The year the Angels won their division was the highlight of niy time here,"" he said. His stadium job represents his third career     one he vows to stay with until he sees the Angels bring a championship for owner Gene Autry, or as long as the city, which owns the stadium, wants him ar""This old building just throbs with the excitement of sports,"" he said. ""I'm here early enough during an event day to watch it come to life and then I see it go to sleep again."" Plumberg was born and raised in Kansas City, Mo. In 1941, he enlisted in the Navy and spent the remaining years of the war as a seaman in the Pacific, taking a short break to fly back to Seattle to get married. He witnessed the signing of the Japanese-American peace treaty in 1945 and stayed in Japan for the first six weeks of the occupation, searching for paint so his ship would look good when it sailed into San Francisco. After retiring as a navy chief, he began his second career with the state's Employment Development Department. When he retired from that job, he devoted himself to his job at the stadium. Plumberg's position is not unlike that of a host working a 69,000-seat restaurant. He and his 235-member crew treat all guests like the famed Rams-owner Georgia Frontiere, who had a suite on the 50-yard line complete with a bed and a hot-tub. ""We're here to make sure the guests are comfortable and to provide the best service possible. There's pride when you work here. People are here because they want to be here,"" Plumberg said.

Savanna trustees OK site lease,Beth Curtis,Anaheim Bulletin,english,"Without discussion, Savanna School District trustees approved a lease of the Mary Perez School site to the city of Stanton Tuesday night, the last legislative step in the process to open a golf practice center on the property. The idea has been in the works for about IV2 years. The Stanton City Council approved the lease in a meeting last month. The city will lease the site, at 10660 Western Ave., from the Savanna School District and then sublease the buildings and grounds to The 1 Golf Co. Stanton has leased the former elementary school from the district since 1984. It was used as Stanton's City Hall until the opening of the new Civic Center in July 1993, after which the 1 Golf Co. approached the city about the site. Superintendent Thomas Halvorsen said he anticipates contraction to begin in late spring, and the business to be open by summer. ""We look forward to this activity for our community,"" he said. The golf practice center should include a driving range, putting course, pro shop and food sales. Terms of the sublease include that the center provide assistance and support for community events, give preference to Stanton residents for employment as far as is legal, and include the name Mary Perez as a prominent feature of the facility. Perez was a custodian in the district for 42 years' and was the first non-teaching employee in the state to have a school named after her in 1967.

Elementary district approves transfer plan,Beth Curtis,Anaheim Bulletin,english,"After considering seven alternatives for handling the projected student increase in the Anaheim City School District, trustees went back to their original plan. The plan approved by district trustees last week will send Learning Handicapped classrooms from Sunkist to Jefferson School, a move that drew an objection at a meeting in January. The single complaint prompted trustees to consider the seven alternatives. Each of the proposals was re viewed during Thursday night's school board meeting. In considering the plans, trustees looked at the effects on instructional programs, the number of students that would be affected, the financial impact and the overall pros and cons. With the exception of the Learning Handicapped classes, the cons of all of the other plans, out weighed those of the original plan, said Mary Ellen Blanton, a deputy superintendent. None of the approximately 40 people in the audience Thursday spoke in opposition to the first proposal. The approved plan will move the Learning Handicapped students from Sunkist to Jefferson, as well as 121 other students from Price to Sunkist School. The plan's benefits include the cost effectiveness of the busing arrangments, long-range student placement and students will not be switched from year-round to traditional school calendars (or vice versa). Ellen Graziano, a special education teacher at Revere School, voiced her support for the original plan in spite of the Learning Handicapped move. She cited her own experience, moving with her students to a new school, as a positive one. ""I don't see that as a con,"" she said. ""I don't think the children suffered."" She said no change in their performance level was observed, and there were benefits, such as new friendships with new schoolmates. Trustee Todd Kaudy said, although only one objection was raised to the original plan, he felt it was his obligation to initiate the search for other options. ""I think that's our responsibility,"" he said. ""If I have an adverse affect on one child, I have to hold myself accountable."" Trustee Benny Hernandez agreed. ",1995,02-Feb

City backs away from plan to cut influence of councils,Michael Easterbrook,Anaheim Bulletin,english,"Pressure from the city's four neighborhood council representatives forced the city to back away from a plan to reduce how much say the councils have in spending $6.4 million in federal grant money. Since 1978, a committee composed of eight neighborhood council representives, one member each from the planning, redevelopment and housing commissions and one from the community services board has submitted recommendations on how to spend the federal funds. Those recommendations are passed along to the City Council, which has final say over how that money is spent. ""The fact that we had eight votes from the neighborhood councils had a huge impact on the budget,"" said Mitch Caldwell, Central City Neighborhood Council president. ""If you take half of that away, I can't help but feel that it's going to change the way the budget looks, when it goes to the council,"" said Caldwell, who also is a planning commissioner. . But while the neighborhood councils will keep the same number of representatives, the panel will receive two more members. One will represent the city's gangdrug task force and the other the city's Private Industry Council.

Community uses often include allowing an organized community league to play at a facility, holding special events for needy groups, providing a meeting place for an organization or dis-> counted use of a facility for underprivileged people. The criteria for choosing a community use is that it help the most number of people. Businesses often are called on by the city to lend help to the area outside of contractual obligations. ""One of the benefits of having Disney in Anaheim is the Disney GOALS program,"" Colson said. Disney GOALS is a youth hockey program that stress citizenship and fair play as a way to build leadership. Other departments in the city, such as economic development, make deals with new businesses that include job training as part of a community benefit. ",1996,27-Aug
"Forum for mayor,council candidates at chamber mixer tonight",Amy Diaz,Anaheim Bulletin,english,"Tinseltown Studios is at 2200 E. Katella Ave., in the parking lot of Edison International Field of Anaheim. Of the 10 candidates for mayor and City Council, eight have run for office in past local elections. Mayor Tom Daly, Councilman Bob Zemel, former councilman Frank Feldhaus, Lucille Kring, Paul Bostwick and Gus Bode all have sought council seats. Daly was first elected to the council in 1988. He was re-elected in 1992 and was elected to the first four-year mayor's seat in 1994. He won his first election for mayor in conjunction with his reelection bid in 1992, when the mayor was elected for two years and had to be a sitting council member. Zemel was elected to the council in 1994 in his third try for a council seat. Feldhaus and Kring finished third and fourth, respectively, in 1996. First-time council candidate Todd Kaudy is an outgoing Anaheim City School District trustee. Leonard Lahtinen, another council contender, is a North Orange County Community College District trustee. The remaining council candidates, John Karczynski and Sean Leonard, are running for their first local elected office. With two council seats and the mayor's seat up for election, the council majority could change after Nov. With the possiblity of a new mayor, council candidates have been slow to declare any specific loyality to any of the mayoral candidates. j Only John Karczynsxi has declared his choice for mayor. ""I want people to know that I support Tom Daly,"" he said. Other council candidates have decided to stay neutral, with the exception of Sean Leonard who said he ""wouldn't support either of them."" Kaudy, 28, has not decided who he'll support. A city school district trustee since 1994, Kaudy is a life-long Anaheim resident. He wants to run for council to ""bring integrity and a sense of leadership back to the council."" He believed last year's campaign finance investigations disgraced the city. ""They took illegal contributions and then wasted the taxpayers money hiring a special prosecutor. Both factions should be reprimanded and not allowed to sit on the council,"" he said. Kaudy wants to pass ordinances regulating campaign spending. He also wants to attack the problem of the hotel children by fining hotel owners who operate unsafe or unclean hotels. He believes more should be done to recruit non-resort industries that provide higher-paying jobs. On the ballot: Anaheim voters will decide among three candidates for mayor and seven candidates for two open City Council seats. And, voters will be asked to approve a measure sponsored by the city's firefighters in their effort to force binding arbitration in contract negotiations with the city. In school board races, only the incumbents filed in the Savanna School Districts filed for the three seats on the ballot. Two incumbents and two challengers have filed for the three seats on the Magnolia School District board. Five candidates have filed for three open seats     all three incumbents are not seeking re-election     on the Anaheim City School District board and six candidates are running for three seats. Susain her bid to fill out the remainder of her term. The November general election will be Nov. 3. Polls will be open from 7 a.m. to 8 p.m. Sample ballots will be mailed Oct. 5. They will include the text of ballot measures, arguments for and against the measure and their rebuttals and candidate statements of those who chose to file them. ",1996,27-Aug
Growing community,DALAL MUHTADI,Anaheim Bulletin,english,"Markets bring bakeries, which bring restaurants and bookstores, such as Abdallah's Dar AI Hayat Bookstore. Dar A1 Hayat means ""home of life"" in Arabic. Immigrants follow the businesses into the area to be close to where they work and shop. Newer immigrants move to the area to be close to friends and family who have settled there before them. A large mosque in nearby Garden Grove and a recently opened mosque in Anaheim provide convenient locations for weekly services for Muslim Arabs. A center of Arab-American social activity is the Jerusalem International Restaurant at 808 S. Brookhurst St. Dalai Muhtadi, 36, has operated the restaurant for eight months. From 7 a.m. until 11 p.m. seven days a week, Muhtadi spends her days in constant activity trying to build up her business and overcome the access-rateior new restaurants. But beyond serving hummos and baba ghannouj, Muhtaiy it something of a community diplomat, acting as go-between for religious leaders, business owners, Arab newspaper operators and her seemingly endless stream of friends and acquaintances. With all of the people dropping in for a quick falafel or holding lunch meetings over stuffed grape leaves on the patio, the Jerusalem has an ""Everyone comes to Rick's"" quality. It shares the shopping center with other businesses catering to Arab-Americans     a bakery, an Islamic dress shop and a jewelry store. In coming weeks, a market is expected to move into the space formerly occupied by Sizzler. An adjacent building also houses a Middle Eastern relief organization, the Orange County Arabic weekly newspaper A1 Watan and Abdallah's bookstore. Muhtadi has capitalized on her valuable location to create the meeting place she felt the ArabAmerican community had been mis""It was very natural. I was longing for a communis center. Running a restaurant is sohectic, I hardly have time to socialize. Here, I can see people. ""Very often, meetings (of businessmen or religious leaders) are all men. My community got used to seeing me in situations with all men,"" she said. ""Our community has not yet achieved the level of organization or infrastructure of other immigrant communities. The generation that immigrated before me did not do their job. New immigrants have to depend on their families (to get acclaimated to America). They don't know how to access the system,"" she said. ""A lot of immigrants carry some of the fear (of governments back home) to the United States. They think it is the same here. They don't realize that here they are free "".A student of international health, she bills the restaurant as natural Mediterranean cuisine. The recipes come from Jordan, Lebanon, Syria, Saudi Arabia and Egypt as well as other countries. Despite the complexity of many Arab dishes, all of the food is made from scratch. Fresh vegetables make up the base for most dishes. Food is cooked in oil or com oil. Muhtadi believes health-conscious Americans can use Middle Eastern food as a doorway to understanding the Arab culture. ""We haven't really started to explain our culture (to Americans). We need to show people there are two sides to the story,"" she said. ""We have a beautiful culture."" For Advertising Information.",1996,27-Aug

And my parents knew I wasn't a great football or basketball player. They came to some of the games and didn't go to others. And they made sure I understood that when I started a season, there were no guarantees of how much I was going to play. I worked hard in practice, and my parents knew that. But they also knew there were other, more talented kids who were going to play more than I would. But many parents seem to think just because their kids work hard they should get a lot of minutes. Unfortunately, as long as we keep score of games, the deciding factor in who plays more is going to be who can help the team win by being on the field. Sometimes I wonder if these parents talk to their kids about how they feel about being on the team if they don't play. I think most kids realize why someone is playing before them. If they don't, parents need to sit down and explain that there's more to life than hard work and that you can't always excel at everything you do. But hard work has its own rewards, and that should be important too. If your kid's role on the team is to be the third-string tight end who helps the starting defense practice for the next week's game, then he should put everything he has into it, even if he knows he won't play much. Because then, if the defense shuts out its opponents next know they had something to do with it. Even if they weren't on the field, their hard work during the week pushed the defense and made it better. We're stuck in a time when individuals seem to mean more than the team. Each parent who complains about their son's or daughter's playing time helps perpetuate this situation. I eventually played tennis in high school, because I was good at it and enjoyed it. If your kid is not happy playing football or volleyball, maybe they shouldn't be playing. Perhaps there's another sport they would enjoy more. Or maybe they can take up an instrument. Or read a book. But if they love the sport, they should love it for what it is and get what they can out of it, whether they start or help keep the bench from floating away.",1996,27-Aug
Prudential firm changes hands in amicable exchange,Patrick Veling's,Anaheim Bulletin,english,"Proving that the local real estate brokerage industry once again shows great promise for revenues and profits, an Orange County brokerage firm has been sold to a friendly competitor. Prudential California Realty, with offices in Mission Viejo and Anaheim Hills, has been sold by owners Rich Cosner and Cheryl Bender to a firm operating under the same name owned by Steve Games and Nida Sterritt. The sale price and terms were not disclosed. Games and Sterritt entered the Orange County landscape last year when they partnered with Rich Cosner to acquire the Ellis Group Better Homes and Gardens. Since then, the firm had risen to become the eighth leading firm in representing Orange County home sellers, according to both local Multiple Listing Services. The sale included a smaller Villa Park satellite office, as well as the firm's mortgage and escrow operations. The sale did not include Cosner's Brea office, which he individually owns, or additional Riverside County offices he individually acquired in recent weeks. Cosner plans to develop his Brea and Riverside County operations in much the same way he did with Cheryl Bender. Bender has not made her plans public. Set on over one acre of impeccably manicured grounds with an impressive circular drive, this exquisite custom estate is being offered by Stephanie Francoeur and Annette Scherrer of Prudential California Realty for $1.450 million. Tennis court, pool and spa, gazebo with outdoor cooking area, and a putting green with sand trap make this home an entertainer's delight.

A 10-year review of trands in apartment sales and prices,James Joseph,Anaheim Bulletin,english,"Special to Real Estate Resource As I look back at the last decade selling apartment buildings, the only word I can use is ""shock."" A lot of investors lost a lot of money, while many more made small fortunes. Real estate careers were ruined and people's lives were shattered. The good news is that through the? end of 1997 (1998 final figures are not in yet), with the exception of four- to 16-unit apartment buildings in Orange County, the decline in values : "" In Orange County, buildings with 17 or more units peaked in 1990 at $73,661 per unit and fell to $44,717 per unit in 1996, a 39.3 percent decline. In fourto 16-unit complexes, they peaked in 1989 at $74,199 per unit and then fell to $59,161 per unit in 1997, a 38.9 percent decline. It's hard to believe, but as of the end of 1997, they had still not registered a full year dr1 ' increase or even a stop ' - decline. This year, however, should reflect the turnaround in smaller units in Orange County. The fact is that it has taken three years for the region as a whole to have experienced a turnaround. While one reads about double-digit price increases in residential homes in Orange County and west Los Angeles, the same cannot be said of apartment building sales. The recovery is here and ongoing, but at this time, according to the statistics, the turnaround is modest. As of the end of 1997, a recovery was not evident in four- to 16- unit buildings in Orange County. The primary driver of value is rents and as they rise, so will apartment values. . . On the other hand, the number of transactions among apartment buildings is another story. In Orange County, in the 17- or-more unit category, there were 85 transactions in 1990 in 1996. This is the recent peak in the number of sales. There were 197 transactions among four- to 16- unit units in 1990 and 387 in 1995 which is the most for the decade. Ironically, as prices. Investors snatched them up and in many categories of 'Units, sales peaked in the 1995- 1997 category. There is no doubt the overall trend is up. The underlying trend that people miss is rents and tenants. Due largely to job celebraties, many tenants balked at high rents from 1990-96. Landlords sensed the reluctance and began discounting rents with free rent and by adding amenities like microwave ovens. Keep in mind many landlords during this five-year period froze rents and if one accepts a 4 percent inflation rate .duping that period, actual   l rents really fell by 20 percent. This is assuming a landloid not lower the rents. As we see demand rise along with landlord confidence, we will see the ""i inevitable rise in rents and then the rise in prices. I Looking back on the debacle; I am amused with those who incorrectly predicted that the; decline was over. As many ,1 readers will recall, many 4 experts beginning in 1992 mistakenly spoke of an upbeat J market right around the corner. In reality, prices went downhill from 1990 to 1996; the longest and most dramatic, value decline in the history California apartment buildings. Those with strong equity positions have weathered the situation fine and many have actually increased their apartment portfolio. Many who leveraged substantially in the late '80s, however, have favourit themselves in precarious suctions. The current Asian crisis am it relates to California real estate is a major unknown possible slowdown in the national economy also may have a negative impact. Job: growth, however, the leading indicator for the future of apartment values, remains strong. ",1996,27-Aug
Mediation dispute of 'reasonable ' work repairs,Rose Pothier,Anaheim Bulletin,english,"My husband and I just canceled a contract to purchase real estate. The contract gave us time to do an inspection. It said we had 10 days to give the seller notice of things we wanted done. Actually, it said we could give him notice of ""reasonable"" items of work we want completed. Then, the seller had five days to respond. He responded and said he would not do all the work we wanted him to do. He said what we wanted was not ""reasonable."" We canceled the contract. Now, we received a notice from an alternative dispute company saying the seller wants to mediate the dispute. We did not initial the arbitration clause in the contract. Do we have to go? Do we need an attorney? It seems like a waste of time because we bought another house. A: If your real estate contract provided for you to mediate disputes with the seller arising out of the real estate contract, then not to be in breach requires you to attend mediation. I believe that whether the repairs or work items you requested were ""reasonable"" will be a topic of the mediation. The seller is upset because you canceled the contract and he may intend to sue you. If you did not sign the arbitration clause in the contract, but did sign the mediation clause, you are contractually bound to mediate, but not arbitrate your dispute. Most forms of residential real estate contracts provide for non-binding mediation to try to resolve conflicts before the parties litigate or arbitrate them. In a mediation proceeding, you do not have to have an attorney represent you. However, if you wish, you may do so. Some people are more comfortable with an attorney present. For others, cost is a big item and attorneys usually cost money. At the hearing, you and the seller shall discuss your contentions with the assistance of a mediator. You and the seller may even go into different rooms so the mediator can speak to you individually about what the other party is asking. The mediator is not an arbitrator or judge. The mediator's role is to try to facilitate the parties reaching an agreement, if possible. In your case, whether you were reasonable in defining the repairs and work items will be the major discussion point.",1996,27-Aug

West Anaheim plan: 63 things to improve,Richard Manfredi,Anaheim Bulletin,english,"City officials held a workshop last Tuesday to introduce a plan they hope will solve several problems in West Anaheim. The West Anaheim Action Plan, presented at a City Council workshop on July 28, spells out 63 items the city wants to focus on during the next few years. The plan is similar in structure to the East Anaheim Action Plan, which was completed last year. Planning Department director Joel Fick said the East Anaheim plan was acted on quickly, with 80 precent of the goals completed after one year. He hopes for similar results in West Anaheim. Fick said the majority of the plan involves the changing of zoning and general plan amendments that must go to the City Council but can be done quickly and without much cost. Several elements of the plan tie into the West Anaheim Redevelopment Plan recently approved by the City Council. Fick said the two plans should compliment each other. Fick said the plan, which covers 2,400 acres from the city   s western border to Gilbert Street, was developed after tmunity meetings attended by more than 200 people, 8,600 field surveys and extensive help from the West Anaheim Neighborhood Development community group. The plan is divided into seven sections, which encompass a variety of city departments. Fick said separate city departments will be responsible for implementing different parts of the plan. The first eight items deal with zoning code amendments. City staff hopes to require conditional use permits before opening a thrift store, coin-operated laundries or drive-through stores such as dry cleaners, pharmacies and banks. Fick said these kinds of businesses, which often stay open late hours and     by their nature     have people milling around, can cause an increase in crime.     There are a lot of things that can be done with the size and the shape of Laundromats, for example,    Fick said.     Hopefully, by making them come before us before opening we can help create better environments.    Another zoning code amendment plann plants and amount of landscaping required at new developments, Fick said certain plants and trees do not provide adequate shade or are not attractive. A series of overall landscape improvements also are included in the plan.",1997,30-Jul

Obviously from the car ahead of me, the cup would now add to the litter scattered around the parking lot. The occupants of the car ahead of me saw my look of surprise and just laughed... I finished my apple for lunch as I was driving to my next appointment. What to do with the apple core? There   s a nice grassy area where the birds can finish off what I don   t want. Out the passenger side window goes the core right into the grass     a good toss. Litter? I didn   t think so. After all, apple core is biodegradable and serves as food for birds and squirrels and ants and... I know there are a lot of birds in Anaheim an there are probably some ants. But there are also children who walk alongside the streets way ahead of their moms or dads who might just be tempted to pick  I decided that my litter was just as bad as that of the plasticcoated drink cup I was so angered about earlier. What makes us litter? Why do I     why do you     toss our trash out of our cars onto a parking lot or a walkway or the grass? Why can   t we just keep our trash with us until we come to a storage container for garbage and then toss it in? Is it impatience? Is it just the inconvenience of having to keep a box or bag for our trash in our own car? Perhaps we are afraid that we will get our own car dirty and then we will have to clean it up. How selfish! Who do we think is going to clean up our trash after we throw it onto someone else   s property? Remember Bill Cosby   s bit about Noah and the ark and the animals and     Who   s going to clean up that mess down there, huh?    Well, God probably had a plan for taking care of that mess, but what about the plans that have to be made     and paid for by someone     to clean up our mess here whech parking lot. There are always people who will drop a chewing gum wrapper (please, not the gum) or a note paper. What is more irritating, though, is when someone decides to empty their car of the sandwich wrapper and drink cup and fries wrapper, etc. instead of putting those items in the Dumpster less than 100 feet from their car. I   m not innocent of the crime of littering     as I mentioned above. I am going to be more thoughtful and keep my trash in my car until I can dispose of it properly. How about you?

The first-ever performance of the Anaheim Union High School District   s Arts Institute on July 23 gave 102 district junior high and high school students an opare obvious oportunity to spend part of their summer learning about an artistic field of their choice. The program was co-sponsored by Disneyland. Kate High Principal Mike Shelton, the district   s performing arts chairman, said the academy came together much more smoothly than he originally anticipated.    But overall I think it was a big success.    Students had to audition to gain admission to the program, which included dance, theater, visual arts and instrumental and vocal music. Shelton said that gave many of the students their first opportunity to experience what it   s like to try-out for a job in the arts. The Arts Institute also he professional side of the entertainment business. Workshops were held on how to audition, how to look for jobs and behindthe-scenes career opportunities.

Her inspiration led her to win second place in this year   s May Family National Art and Writing Contest sponsored by the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum. Students nationwide were asked to prepare either written or artistic responses to this year   s contest question: How do you think an individual     whether acting alone or in a group     could have helped to rescue Jews being persecuted by the Nazis and their collaborators?

Message of imily and brotherhood,Katherine Nguyen,Anaheim Bulletin,english,"They came armed with steel bats, their faces set with grim determination. Two rival neighborhood gangs came face-to-face Sunday afternoon to duke it out   on a softball field at Boysen Park. The two neighborhoods, Westside Anaheim and Varrio Underhill (Eastside Anaheim), gathered together to play the first of a b^-of-five co-ed softball tournament to spread a message of unity and brotherhood. It was a strange sight to behold for about 100 spectators who came to watch the game in the hot afternoon sun. The two gangs have a long history of bitter hostility and violence.    I am rooting for both teams,    said 44-year-old Anaheim resident Danny Romero Sr.     I want them to meet together as real people, and not see each other as who   s better on what side of the street. Besides, this is better than having them shoot at each other,    he said. During the game, players were heard cheering on teammates but there was plenty of light hearted taunting as well. One player from Underalf-jokingly pleaded with a Westside female batter.     Please strikeout, please,    he chanted. Others chased and sprayed each other with water in an effort to beat the sweltering heat. Many of the male players stripped off their shirts to reveal elaborate tattoos, all displaying their neighborhood namesake. The game was made possible by Solevar, a nonprofit grassroots outreach group that helps to alleviate tension between atrisk neighborhoods. Seferino Garcia, the executive director, is hoping to create a United Varrio Power neighborhood softball league. Both teams chipped in to reserve the playing field for the day   s game as well as their team T-shirts, all printed with the United Varrio Power logo.     With everyone chipping in, it really makes them feel that everyone contributed, that they all made this happen,    Garcia said. Garcia said the league is in desperate need of sports equipment and is hoping that B.U.M. Equipment will sponsor its next game on Aug. 9.     ay,    said Holly Perez, who came up with the league name.

Daughter of Eli Home founder files complaint,Richard Manfredi,Anaheim Bulletin,english,"The teen-age daughter of the woman who founded a shelter for abused children in Anaheim Hills has filed a written complaint against Councilman Lou Lopez, accusing him of intimidation. City Attorney Jack White said police are investigating a complaint submitted by Tammy Galloway, daughter of E li Home, Inc. founder Lorri Galloway, that Lopez intimidated her at a Sizzler restaurant in June. Tammy said she approached Lopez, who was dining at the eatery, and asked him why he voted in May not to renew E li Home   s permit to operate the shelter. Tammy was working as a waitress at the time of the incident.    He said that he voted against (the permit) because he was sworn to protect the children of Anaheim, and he had heard reports that children were being abused inside the home,    she said. Lopez, airalice officer, then showed her his badge and asked if she knew who he was, the daughter claims.     There was no reason for Mr. Lopez to show me his badge and tell me he is a cop other than fos no threat of violence,    Tammy said in the written complaint. Tammy said Lopez asked if she knew that the E li Home   s owners lived in a $300,000 home in Anaheim Hills.     I asked if he knew who I was, and I told him I was the Galloways    daughter.    Tammy submitted the written complaint at the July 14 City Council meeting. The council voted 3-2 in mid-May not to renew the shelter   s permit. Three council members felt the shelter did not fit in its residential location because of complaints of lack of parking and substandard street widths. At the July 24 council meeting, Lopez defended himself, saying Tammy didn   t appear to be paying close attention to the conversation.     She kept glancing over her shoulder because she was worried about her job,    he said. Lopez also said during the meeting that he had offered to pay $5,000 to help the E li Home relocate with the help of an unnamed church in Anaheim Hills.

Garden Church recreates landmarks from Jerusalem,Hang Nguyen,Anaheim Bulletin,english,"He hopes to bring them closer to God. For 30 years, it has been the Rev. Bryan Crow   s dream to build an indoor outdoor chapel to resemble biblical landmarks in Jerusalem. In the beginning of August, he and the Anaheim Hills Garden Church members will finally see this project reach its genesis. Crow said the church, which sits on a hill, is the     perfect setting,    for this miniature Holy Land and permanent sanctuary. It was an idea borne 30 years ago when he realized Southern California   s climate resembles that in Jerusalem. Church members such as Cindy Maddox are excited about making this church, which is a garden, more distinctive.     I think it might draw new people in. Some people don   t have the means to go to Jerusalem. Soon, people can go there and see Jesus    life beginnings,    said Maddox, who   s never been to Jerusalem, but would like to go. The constnictimi includes a replica of the Garden Tomb, believed by some to be the burial plac grove where Jesus was said to pray before his crucifudon; and die Hill of the Cross, the skull shaped area where Jeans is have been crucified. A stream representing the Jordan River will be completed by Easter, with the garden to follow by late 1999, officials said. Jimmie Robeson says the biblicallandmark, scheduled to open Sunday, will spiritua connect her more to God.     I think it   s terrific. I think anytime you do anything to remind you of Jesus Christ   s beginning, you feel closer to him. I (would) feel a kinship,    said Robestm, who   s been attending the church for five years. Robeson, who has lived in Southern California for 10 years, thinks you should be able to bask in the sun during worship.     We   re so privileged to have wonderful weather in California. We need to have outdoor worship,    she said.    Nie indoor outdoor chapel is to seat about 300 people. The chapel will be the first permanent building for the church. For nine years,    It (the chapel) is a beautiful, casual outdoor place to worship and study,    he said. His City Council approved zoning for the chapel Ju ly 14. As far as Crow knows, there is no other chapel around like the one to be built. The idea was spariced by church trips to Jerusalem. Crow has not received any opposition to the construction of me chapel. ",1997,30-Jul

Lopez baclced by group opposing commercial development in Hills,Hang Nguyen,Anaheim Bulletin,english,"The Concerned Citizens of the Canyon, a group formed to oppose commercial development proposed for Anaheim Hills, is supporting Councilman Lou Lopez   s bid for county supervisor. The group has endorsed Lopez, who also works at the Anaheim Police Department, in his race against Cynthia Coad, a member of the North Orange County Com   munity College District board.     So far, every issue they brought (to my attention), I agree with,    Lopez said. Those issues include plans to build a commercial center on the Maag Ranch property, the county   s plans for a commercial airport at the El Toro base, and the city   s plans for a community center at the Anaheim Memorial Medical Plaza on Santa Ana Canyon Road. Lopez, one of four council members who live in the Hills, said he would have voted against the revised Maag Ranch project proposed by GMEk development if the project had not been withdrawn from the city the day before City Council was to have voted on it June 23. The mostly comnta Ana Canyon Road. Had the council considered the project on June 23 vote would have been the deciding factor since the other four council members were split in their votes. He said his job as councilman is to do the best thing for the city and in that instance the resident opinions were a factor.     The residents have a tremendous influence,    he said. The grow is also against turning the El Toro Marine Corps Air Station into an airport. If elected, Lopez said he will continue to be an advocate for children.

City rejects bids by 2 cab com p  n,Richard Manfredi,Anaheim Bulletin,english,"Even though tourism and convention numbers are projected to be down during the next two to three years, taxi cab companies still believe Anaheim is a prime area for expansion. The city already has two companies that provide pick-up service here and two other companies came before the City Council on July 21 to ask permission to begin service in Anaheim. But the council voted 3-2 against adding new taxi cab services, echoing the recommendations of city staff, which said there isn   t a need for additional taxi service. Mayor Tom Daly and Councilman Lou Lopez supported the additional service. Councilmen Bob Zemel and Tom Tait and Councilwoman Shirley McCracken voted no.     We   ve looked to see if there have been complaints to the Visitor and Convention Bureau about taxi cab service and there haven   t been,    said John Poole, city code enforcement manager.     We have faith in the information that we   re receiving from them.    Poole also said the city maintaihotels in Anaheim about the current taxi situation.     If there have been any problems, they   ve not been brought my attention,    he said. Representatives from South Coast Cab Co. and the Coast Yellow Cab Cooperative tried to convince the council there was a need for more taxi service in Anaheim. South Coast Cab wanted permits to operate 40 cabs and Coast Yellow Cab wanted to have 30 permitted taxis. Karen Clark, a representative from South Coast Cab, pointed to a survey done by code enforcement staff last December as proof of a need for more taxis. City staff had volunteers makes six calls for taxi cab service with the two companies currently in Anaheim, A Taxi Cab and Yellow Cab, and record the response times. Most of the calls were for services from the west end of Anaheim to the east side or vice versa. Clark said that of the 12 total calls, five calls took more than 20 minutes for response, and service in Anaheim,    Clark said. Poole presented a similar survey done on June 30, response time of 11.6 minutes for Yellow Cab and 14.8 minutes for A Cab, with a maximum response time of 27 minutes.     That   s too long to have to wait for a cab,    Daly said. Lopez said if there isn   t a need for more taxis, then companies would not be coming forward to try to gain permits in operate in the city.     Why would a company commit business suicide by setting up shop where there isn   t a need?    he said. South Coast Cab had offered a compromise that would allow them only to accept calls and not sit in lines at hotels and Disneyland. But Poole said that would make enforcement even more difficult.     We have to push the envelope to enforce what we have now,    he said. Taxis that are permitted to make pick-ups in Anaheim have to display a window sticker. However, any cab company can drop people off in Anaheim from another city. Surface streets have had to deal with construction related to improvements of their own     Sirimarily aof the construction work has created clouds of dust. All of this means that the city is estimating a drop off in revenues brought in by the transient occupany tax     the IS percent tax on the room rates of people staying in hotels and motels in Anaheim. Word of the construction is being filtered to large groups that are planning on visiting Anaheim. Before arriving in the city for their annual convention, members of the Fraternal Order of Elks read about the construction . Problems in their monthly magazine. A picture of a city road sign that reads     Imagination at Work, Drive Slowly,    was published along with a caption warning Elks of potential problems.     Travelers in Anaheim this summer will no doubt come across construction signs like this one,    the caption reads.     Because of Anaheim   s current $550 million revitalization of the city   s infrastructure, it   s a good idea to plan ahead to avoid heavy traffic.    However, most of the convention didn   t seem to affetted by the construction.     From what little we   ve seen, we   ve really liked Anaheim,     said Harry Tanger, a New Jersey native who was planning on spending extra time in Anaheim with his family after the convention ended last Wednesday.     I was a little concerned about the construction and the roadways,    said Tanger, who was staying at the Anaheim Hilton and Towers hotel next to the Convention Center.     But it hasn   t really been a problem for us. It might have been worse for some other people who were staying further away from the Convention Center, but it hasn   t been a problem for us.    Elaine Cali of the Anaheim orange County Visitor and Convention Bureau said an aggressive marketing campaign is under way to promote Anaheim as a vacation and convention spot. A $7SO,000-a-year advertising campaign has been started, focusing mainly on print advertising in Northern California and the Southwest, Cy in Anaheim, but Cali said city officials are trying to work in coopoeration with the tourism industry to make things go as smoothly as possible.

Hot was anapproriate term to describe the team then as well.     We were playing a game at noon, and then at two o   clock,    said coach B ill Rivera about the La Mirada tournament.     The sun was beating down and they only had a chance to get a quick rest and drink of water before they started again.    Playing in those conditions required a deep team, and Rivera said that helped carry them through the tournament.     Everyone (Hi this team contributed,    he said.     Everyone played their roles and handled themselves really well.    Rivera said one of the secrets to the team   s success is that the players have been ey finish each other   s sentences and sometimes have the same responses in unison to questions. The team has been pushing to play the league   s under-12 All Star team, but hasn   t been able to schedule a game yet. The under-10 team thinks its older counterparts have been ducking them. The under-10 team seems to think that 'the under-12 team would be much more of a challenge than a team of boys.     Boys can   t play softball as good as girls can.    Rivera thinks having three weeks of between the regional tournament and the national championship will be good.     They were really excited after they won, but I think that   s worn off a little bit and they   re     But I    m sure they   ll be nervous come the first game.    As will Rivera. The coaching staff tracked pitches in practice to see who threw the most strikes to decide who would be the pitchers. Rivera   s daughter Karina was one of the ones selected.     Nowuse my daughter   s up there pitching,    he said. In its regional championship win over Rancho Santa Margarita, West Anaheim built a 6-0 lead going into the last inning, only to see it be whitled away to 6-S, when Kelly Lopez made a stab at a line drive to end the game. Rivera said winning a national championship would mean a lot for the league.     You can advertise that you have a national champion, the girls talk to their friends and get them to play, it   s all great,    he said. The players don   t really care that much about what winning the national championship would mean for the league. They just know what it would mean to them.

You don't have to belong to the church to skate or even go to church. ""It's not really weird to come here,"" Dye said. ""It's just a place to skate."" Places to skate have been hard comedy locally. But Bonnie Garabedian said the police have been very receptive about the skate night at the church. ""They think it's a great way to get the kids off the street,"" she said. And as far as the Garabedians are concerned, skating in Anaheim is going to be around for a long time and they are in it for the long haul. ""I'm not a skateboarder, but I don't try to pretend with the kids that I am,"" Art Garabedian said. ""But we're going to make most of our business on the tourists so we can always try to do something for these kids in the city.""",1998,27-Aug
Sportstown deal has community use element ,Amy Diaz,Anaheim Bulletin,english,"As part of the city's deal with Forest City Development, the new Sportstown entertainment complex will provide $100,000 a year for free community use. Just what that use will be has not been decided yet. The city will negotiate individual terms for community use with each tenant. The city has made no decisions on which community groups will receive the community use. Tenants will be announced on or before Dec. IS. ""We are always concerned with getting the maximum benefit for the most people,"" said Bret Colson, city spokesman. When the Walt Disney Co. built Disney ICE downtown, the city secured the use of the rink for area schools. The Community Development Department helped the Anaheim Union High School District, Anaheim City School District and Magnolia School District get access to the rink for before and after school programs to teach ice skating to youngsters. Since October 1995, when the program began, the rink has provided the city with about $300,000 per year in community use. The department monitors the program to make sure that the use is consistent with the contract. ""(We wanted) to served theredevelopment area first and then push out the benefits as far as we can,"" said Terry Lowe, head of recreation in the community development department. ""Over 110,000 children receive free skating lessons."" Community uses often include allowing an organized community league to play at a facility, holding special events for needy groups, providing a meeting place for an organization or dis* counted use of a facility for underprivileged people. The criteria for choosing a community use is that it help the most number of people. Businesses often are called on by the city to lend help to the area outside of contractual obligations. ""One of the benefits of having Disney in Anaheim is the Disney GOALS program,"" Colson said. Disney GOALS is a youth hockey program that stress citizenship and fair play as a way to build leadership. Other departments in the city, such as economic development, make deals with new businesses that include job training as part community benefit.",1998,27-Aug
Microsoft gives Police Department award,Amy Diaz,Anaheim Bulletin,english,"The Police Department received a special award of recognition Aug. 11 from Microsoft for making arrests in a software piracy case earlier this month. Microsoft official Al Cabaral off presented two plaques, one for Detective Mel Vyborney and one for die Police Department as a whole during a City Council meeting. Hi plaques were in appreciation of the July 8 arrest of two suspects involved in manufacturing pirated Microsoft Windows '98 software. ""It was the first time we've confiscated such a large cache of pirated software. Using undercover reverse sting tactics, we have been working on this for months,"" said Lt. Jack Parra of the economics crimes unit. ""(Piracy) represents a tremendous loss to the software industry."" The illegal software was being sold at $10 per unit. The police bought 1,100 units for $11,000. The retail value of 1,100 units of legitimate Windows '98 is $136,000. Parra said most cases of software piracy are investigated by die company that makes the software, which gives the evidence to the police. This was one of the first times the police took charge of the investigation from the beginning. He said the department used techniques similar to those used for illegal drug and stolen property cases to catch the counterfeiters. ""With today's technology, criminals can manufacture anything you-want. You can buy very expensive software for $2S. But it make software cost more down the road and there's no guarantiee that it's any good,"" Parra said. The Police Department has been trying to catch up with technology. The computer industry has trained police on how to detect fraudulent microprocessors. Police also are learning to detect credit card and Internet scams.

Abdallah, owner of the area's only Arabic bookstore, sells everything from newspapers and magazines from the Middle East to books on north African politics imported from England. Her store is part of a growing community of Arab owned and operated businesses on a strip of south Brookhurst Street. Estimates for the Arab-American community range from more than 200,000 in Orange County to half a million in all of Southern California. Most government agencies that keep track of who lives where, such a s the Census Bureau, do not know how big the Arab-American community in Anaheim is because it is part of the all-encompassing ""other "" category. What can be pinned down is the center of that community. It's in Anaheim, on Brookhurst Street. Markets, clothing stores, cafes and restaurants focused on Middle Eastern culture set the Brookhurst shops apart from the normal strip mall fare.

Arab-Americans fear retaliation; stereotypes ,Amy Diaz,Anaheim Bulletin,english,"Not all casualties of war are on the battlefield. Friendly fire can extend to those at home. When die President Clinton ordered strikes on suspected terrorist sites in Sudan and Afghanistan last Thursday, some ArabAmericans worried about the reverberations. There is a fear that the media will portray all Arabs or all Muslims in a negative light because of the events overseas. ""Each religion has crazy people. (The media) have to differentiate between the mainstream and the fringe. There is a lack of knowledge and a lack of information (about the Arabic culture),"" said Hussam Ayloush, regional director for the Council on American-Islamic Relations. ""A lot of the stereotypes are based on ignorance and also a reluctance on the part of Muslims to explain their culture. Islam is Ayloush said many other ethnic groups went through similar periods of adjustment with mainstream culture. ""Islam is still new to America. The media don't know how to deal with it. Is it political, religious, they aren't sure,"" Ayloush said. The first mistake people often make is in assuming that all Arabs are Muslims or that all Muslims are Arabs, he said l Muslims are followers of Islam. Arab refers to a person from the countries on the Arabian peninsula or north Africa. Though many Arabs are Muslim; millions of Arabs are Christians. Bassam Nezam, marketing director for the weekly Al Watan    an Arabic language newspaper that covers Orange County, fears that school children will feel ostricized because of their Arab heritage even though they are U If (children) are made to feel like terrorists, they will be confused....

Everyone doesn't get time on field,RICHARD MANFREDI,Anaheim Bulletin,english,"Occasionally, after I write a profile on a team or athlete, I'll get a message on my voice mail. Usually it's anonymous, and usually the voice on the other line in angry. Partially they're angry at me, but mainly they're angry at the coaching staff because their son or daughter isn't getting enough playing time. Sometimes I think their gripes are valid. Some coaches do play favorites because they went to school with a kid's dad or they coached someone since first grade or many other reasons. But often I think there's another, deeper reason why certain youngsters don't see a lot of action in high school sports. It's that they aren't very good. I know this might be a shock to a lot of parents, so let me give you an example. There are 11 players on a football team on offense and defense. Since, in high school, players often play both sides of the ball, there probably aren't 22 positions available to start. But let's assume there are. That means that 22 athletes will start, and maybe another 10 will see significant time as back ups. If there are 65 players on a team, the math shows us that almost half the team is going to spend most of its time on the bench. Part of me has an affinity for these kids, since I was one of them. I wasn't that big growing up, not was I very fast. I wasn't the last player choosen for pickup games, but I certainly wasn't the first. I played youth sports up until high school, played a little but mostly drank ? lot of Qatorade. ",1998,27-Aug
Getting a kick out of practice,RICHARD MANFREDI,Anaheim Bulletin,english,"The sun was beating down Friday on the players practicing at the University of California, Irvine. Each unit had its own drills, guided by an assistant coach. Away from the main practice stood three players with a bunch of footballs and no coaches. The three kickers on the University of Southern California football team would kick a ball, watch it sail toward the uprights, and then kick another one. A large crowd was gathered to watch practice, one of the last ones open to the public before the team's opening game against Purdue on Sunday. The only people watching the kickers, however, were about six or seven school-age children who would fight each other for the balls after every kick. After the kicker's ball supply was used up, one of them would go chase the youngsters around to collect all the balls. Then he would trudge back to the field, distribute the balls accordingly, and everyone would start kicking again. This was how two hours of practice went for the kickers, and how the better part of two weeks of two practices a day have gone. The three kickers know their role on the team, and it isn't to block or tackle or run. It's to kick the bail as far as they can     high enough for a return team to get under it for the punters, between the uprights for the placekickers. David Bell has to know how to do everything.

High Holy Days chance to reconnect with faith,Amy Diaz ,Anaheim Bulletin,english,"The High Holy Days of Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur are an opportunity for many people to reconnect with their Jewish faith.

Cerritos Ave., will celebrate the holidays with services that see such a large attendence that tickets will be needed to keep the number of worshippers from over reaching the amount of space. Rabbi Mordecai Kieffer presides over the services. Rosh Hashanah was Monday, Yom Kippur is next Tuesday. The ELzra Center, which operates in three north county synagogues, provides the large congregation with programs.

It serves as a place for people with free time during the day, many of them retired, to get together to play cards and socialize. The program is free with a $10 annual membership. A kosher lunch is offered for $4. Temple Beth Emet also offers youth religious education and day care during services. Temple Adat Ari, a conservative synagogue at 5100 E.

He   s seen colorful canopies, faces painted, mouths chatter, faces smile     Lopez has seen the Hills community come together as one, big, happy family at the San Antonio Catholic Church every year since 1978.    This is probably the largest function in the Canyon,    said Lopez about the popular Fiesta Time organized by the church in third week of September every year since it was formed. In fact, it was the fiesta that funded the church building which was dedicated in 1981. Until then, the parish got together at the El Rancho Middle School auditorium. The church turned 21 on Wednesday. Lopez still volunteers for the fiesta. Sitting inside a supply truck, giving instructions and chatting with his friend Pete Witte, they both recalled the beginnings.     You know, Angelo was the chairman for the very first fiesta ,    Witte said.   ing in with a laugh.    There was no building here, just weeds. And our major task w as to pull out the weeds. I swear, some of those weeds were as tall as "" They then cleared the ground and put sawdust on it.     Angelo, remember our first one on the"" asked Witte. Angelo nodded, smiling.    We've come a long way from there, as you can see,    he said. Today, the fiesta is a huge affair with hundreds of people not only from Anaheim Hills but also from neighboring areas such as Yorba Linda and Placentia. What started as an informal bake sale with a few game stands, now' has close to 35 booths including rides, games, a pastry booth, a beer garden and even a sports bar. There are no outside vendors. Every booth is m an    aged by a volunteer. The event has tripled in term s of attendance, said the Rev. Seam us Glynn. And th a t   s because the number of families that attend church has increased from 600 to 3,000 through the years, he said. This year, added attractions were balloon hats, a clown and a speedball stand for the sports jocks, said Jesse Guerrero, event chairman. The other popular events were bingo, the garage sale, crafts for kids and the auction. The event is also an opportunity for teen-agers to get together outside school,bois of Yorba Linda. Charlebois along with her friend Rebecca Fortezzo, who lives in Anaheim Hills has enjoyed the fiesta as long she remembers.

This is a small town,    she said,     but there    s a lot to do.    Ultimately, for Angelo Lopez and the hundreds of people who enjoyed their weekend at the carnival, that is exactly what it boils down to.

"Physical, spiritual hearts beat strong",Jeff Bowman,Anaheim Bulletin,english,"I'd like to explore this with you within the pages of the Bible. If you want, take your Bible and look up to lie references I   ll site for you, First, we must start with who you look like. I    m sure you bear resemblance (for better or worse) with someone in your earthly family. But the Bible tells us more. When God created humanity, he made us in his image (Gen. 1:26-2H; 5:1; 9;6). The significance of this is great. It explains our desire to create. Just as God is the creator, so some of us spend our entire lives as artists, inventors or pursuing hobbies centered around crafts. Humanity also has a strong desire to know and learn. This, too, is an imitation of God. The Bible is abundant with verses that show God watching, looking and testing     all within the sphere of his omniscience. You also see humanity seeking to control and manage. From the very beginning we read of God wanting to direct humanity and guide us without violating our free wills. Something has happened to us, however. That we are created in became damaged. Our disobedience     or sin     cut us off from God and caused us to die physically (Rom. 5:12-14). The image that we are created in is marred by sin. The positive attributes of creating, learning and managing now have the potential to become self-serving traits that often bring harm to fellow human beings. All who read the paper read these things daily. The laws of the heart speak out Sociologists and anthropologists have confirmed that there is not a society that has been discovered that does not display some form of the Ten Commandments. Even in lands that have never had contact with the Bible, people display the laws of God written on their hearts (Rom. 2:14, IS). Think about it. Haven't you felt your heart convicting you of your personal failure to keep the jaws of the heart? Thank (Jod he did not leave us in such a     heart failure.    He has provided us with the opportunity to get a new heart by the power of his spirit. Listen to your heartheim, for the first time in its history, began its club year in September.

San Antonio church holds 21st annual fiesta,Deepa Bharath,Anaheim Bulletin,english,"Angelo Lopez has seen 20 fiestas. He   s heard kids scream on roller coasters, he's smelled those charred burgers and plump hotdogs. He   s seen colorful canopies, faces painted, mouths chatter, faces smile     Lopez has seen the Hills community come together as one, big, happy family at the San Antonio Catholic Church every year since 1978.    This is probably the largest function in the Canyon,    said Lopez about the popular Fiesta Time organized by the church in third week of September every year since it was formed. In fact, it was the fiesta that funded the church building which was dedicated in 1981. Until then, the parish got together at the El Rancho Middle School auditorium. The church turned 21 on Wednesday. Lopez still volunteers for the fiesta. Sitting inside a supply truck, giving instructions and chatting with his friend Pete Witte, they both recalled the beginnings.     You know, Angelo was the chairman for the very first fiesta ,    Witte said.   ing in with a laugh.    There was no building here, just weeds. And our major task w as to pull out the weeds. I swear, some of those weeds were as tall as "" They then cleared the ground and put sawdust on it.     Angelo, remember our first one on the"" asked Witte. Angelo nodded, smiling.    We've come a long way from there, as you can see,    he said. Today, the fiesta is a huge affair with hundreds of people not only from Anaheim Hills but also from neighboring areas such as Yorba Linda and Placentia. What started as an informal bake sale with a few game stands, now' has close to 35 booths including rides, games, a pastry booth, a beer garden and even a sports bar. There are no outside vendors. Every booth is m an    aged by a volunteer. The event has tripled in term s of attendance, said the Rev. Seam us Glynn. And th a t   s because the number of families that attend church has increased from 600 to 3,000 through the years, he said. This year, added attractions were balloon hats, a clown and a speedball stand for the sports jocks, said Jesse Guerrero, event chairman. The other popular events were bingo, the garage sale, crafts for kids and the auction. The event is also an opportunity for teen-agers to get together outside school,bois of Yorba Linda. Charlebois along with her friend Rebecca Fortezzo, who lives in Anaheim Hills has enjoyed the fiesta as long she remembers.     I used to enjoy throwing darts and the goldfish g am e,   ""Now, I just enjoy the people. I like to hang out with my friends. It   s the only event in the year that we get to do that. I wish there were more of these.    The fiesta also appeals to firsttimers. Jewell Bonilla moved from El Centro to the Hills recently and she said it   s a great opportunity for her to get to know other people in the community.    This is a small town,    she said,     but there    s a lot to do.    Ultimately, for Angelo Lopez and the hundreds of people who enjoyed their weekend at the carnival, that is exactly what it boils down to.

In Orange County, the number of homes that sold for $1 million or more increased by 50 percent in 1997, and 28 percent during the first eight months of 1998.    We recognize this trend of a growing high-end market, and we   re answering the call,       Mathis said.    We   re combining the most advanced technology with sophisticated marketing tools that are far superior to anything available in the market today.

Mortgage lender announces    Adopt A School    program to assist l,Steve Mathi,Anaheim Bulletin,english,"American Financial Group of Orange, a local m ortgage lending company, has named Woodsboro Elementary School in Anaheim as the first of their    Adopt A School    program target schools.    Our business is providing homeowners with mort[gages for the purchase or ref"" said Steven Sofka, one of the owners of the company.    The intent of our    Adopt A School    program is to provide support to a local school by donations of financial and or materials assistance to the school through the school   s PTA.    The company will mark a portion of the profits we derive from our business generated in a given community, and donate it to the targeted school in this care, that would be Woodsboro.    Sofka said that by being an active PTA parent and serving on a number of other school committees, he has a firsthand perspective and really appreciates the tremendous value that business affiliations like this can bring to a school.    Frankly, I can   t think of a better way to enrich a com m unity than by assisting the teachers and schools in their efforts to provide a quality education for our kids. Through the years, many local communities have been very supportive of our business and this is our way of thanking them and acknowledging thirst time Furla visited the property, he picked up both a flyer - which did not mention the square footage of the property and a copy of the listing profile as it appeared in the Multiple Listing System (MLS). The MLS showed that the property was approximately 5,500 square feet. The MLS printout included the common warning that the information, while deemed reliable, was not guaranteed. The figures entered into the MLS came from Krasinski's agent who, in turn, had obtained the 5500-square-foot number from Krasinski's daughter. The daughter had told the agent the number came from the architectural plans. (In fact, the plans showed 5,334 square feet.) Moreover, the seller's agent was subsequently provided an appraisal which showed that the house was 5,500 square feet. Furla's agent also provided him with a ""property profile"", a document obtained through a title company showing information compiled from tax assessor records. That document also showed the size of the improved property as 5,500 square feet. Similar to the MLS document, the property profile included a notation stating, 'The accuracy of the above information is deemed reliable but is not guaranteed.    Furla's initial offer was written on June 16, 1993. The next day both he, the seller, and agents conducted verbal negotiations, during which Furla sa""Okay, 5,500 square feet, I'll pay $170 a foot."" He then entered the numbers into a calculator and held up the resultinfigure of $935,000. The seller (Krasinski) accepted this figure, whereupon the counteroffer was modified and signed. During the course of the escrow Furla had reservations, commonly called ""buyer's remorse,"" and wondered if he had paid too much. His agent provided him with MLS material showing other Mount Olympus properties at prices ranging from $180 to $235 per square foot. He subsequently closed escrow and took possession on July 30, 1993. When Furla made his offer he did so using a Fred Sands contract which, among other things, states that ""...Broker makes no representations with respect to the...square footage of the lot or the improvement thereon...and [information materials] provided in the Multiple Listing Service...are approximations only."" The contract goes on to say, (in all capital letters,) that the broker recommends that the buyer hire an appropriate professional to investigate the property, and it (the contract) reminds the buyer that he has a duty under the Civil Code ($2079) to make his own investigations. So, 18 months later, Furla decided to sell the property. In the course of interviewing potential listing agents he was told by one, ""There is no way this house is 5,500 square feet."" That agent then did an informal """"stepping off' of the property, and calculated it was about 4,130 square feet. Naturally, Furla then hired professional appraisers to measure the property. One came up with 4,615 square feet; the other with 4,437. Also, it came out in the trial, that Furla's purchase-lender appraisal (July 9, 1993) showed the property to be 4,311 square feet. Furla had not been informed of that result at the time. He was simply told that the property had appraised for the purchase price. Of course, Furla sued the seller and the seller's agent. He did not sue his own agent. He brought action for damages based on intentional misrepresentation and concealment, negligent misrepresentation and negligence, and for rescission. What would you say? The trial court granted sum m ary judgment for the defendants, but the court of appeals reversed on issues of negligence and negligent m isrepresentation. It also reversed on the m atter of rescission. Needless to say, this is an important case. It raises serious questions about the liability of a real estate agent, not to mention the responsibility of a buyer. Next week, we will consider som e of the im plications and questions to be raised in light of Furla v. Jon Douglas Co.

Term limit provisions aired by council,Amy Diaz,Anaheim Bulletin,english,"Councilman Bob Zemel is waging battle over Anaheim's sixyear-old term limit law in his campaign for mayor against in cumbent Tom Daly. Zemel charges Daly ""adjusted the law to fit only himself"" and with ""inserting language to allow Daly to serve 14 years."" ""The people of Anaheim should be on equal status with the mayor. He has already served two years more than I'll be allowed or anyone else in Anaheim will be allowed. How elitist is it to say I'll vote for term limits for you but not for me?"" Zemel said. Daly, who was elected to the council in 1988 and re-elected in 1992, denies the charges. ""His statements are not true,"" Daly said. City records show that Daly did not comment on the clause, except to vote to place it on that November's ballot. The minutes of the July 28, 1992, council meeting show that then-Mayor Fred Hunter asked City Attorney Jack White about the clause allowing sitting council members to run for mayor in 1994 and re-election as mayor in 1998     one of five options presented to the council at that meeting. Minutes from a council discussion on July 21, 1998, show Daly saying he thought it was unfair to apply the eight-year limit to sitting council members who would become ineligible to seek re-election if the measure passed. But Daly voted for the measure     including the limit on sitting council members     the following week. The term limit ballot measure was offered in a motion by former councilman William Ehrle.

Measure A effort to end fire contract negotiations,Amy Diaz,Anaheim Bulletin,english,"The Anaheim Firefighters Association has qualified a measure for the November ballot that calls for impartial arbitration of labor disputes between the city and the Fire Department. The ballot measure is an effort to end more than two years of negotiations that have failed to produce a new contract. Measure A would amend the section of the City Charter that governs the city's personnel system to prohibit strikes and adopt a method of binding impartial arbitration when good faith negotiations do not result in an agreement. The measure calls for an arbitration board made up of three members     one picked by the city, one picked by the employee organization and one agreed upon by both     to settle differences. In a report released in August, Public Financial Management, Inc. a consulting firm hired by the city, concluded that the potential advantages of arbitration are a possible improvement in empl""by providing a viable avenue for labor to challenge contract disputes"" and finality in the negotiation process. The disadvantages are that arbitration discourages good-faith negotiations, prevents elected officials from making final budget decisions, could cost between $100,000 to $200,000 per arbitration, increase salaries and wages and impacts terms of employment. According to David Hill, city human resources director, the city has made three contract proposals. The Firefighters Association has declined to vote or voted down all three proposals. Hill believes arbitration will not benefit either party. ""I have of faith in collective bargaining. It is not in the long-term interest of either party to have someone impose a contract on them,"" Hill said. Hill also believes that arbitration places negotiations in the hands of people with no accountability to the voters. ""It is in the public interest to have elected officials represent them and to hold the accountable. To have arbitrators spend public funds is not in the public interest,"" he said. But Anaheim Firefighters Association president Richard Chavez said he is willing to risk being unhappy with the results. ""Arbitrators look at what's fair. They look at the municipalit's ability to pay and the job market. To drag out negotiations for over two years and work without a contract is unfair,"" Chavez said. He cites the city's use of arbitration in rights disputes as an example of how the process already works in Anaheim. ""Firefighters are very involved in the community. We wouldn't do anything (such as strike) to jeopardize the community,"" he said. Since striking would endanger the public, Chavez feels arbitration would be the best tool for the association in its negotiations with the city.",2000,17-Sep
"Public benefit fee draws fire, but it's a state mandate",Amy Diaz,Anaheim Bulletin,english,"In an effort to bill themselves as anti-tax, City Council candidates are coming out against the public benefits fee that appears on all electric bills of customers of the city's Public Utilities Department. But by making a big issue out of a little fee, candidates are ignoring an important detail: the fee is part of the state law that restructured the electric industry. Far from being a tax imposed by the City Council, the fee is mandatory. Article eight under Assembly Bill 1890 requires that ""each local publicly owned electric utility shall establish a non by passable, usage-based charge on local distribution service,"" according to section 385 of the California Public Utilities Code. The fee is 2.8S percent of a user's bill. In Anaheim, 60 percent of the money is used on energy efficiency programs, 18 percent pays for assistance lowincome customers, 1 percent funds renewable energy and 21 percent funds research of electric-related technologies. ""The fee is absolutely mandatory,"" said Lon Topaz, intergrated resources manager for the city. ""If the city utility did not collect the fee, it would be in violation of state law."" While no penalty for not following the law is listed in the code, the city would be vulnerable to lawsuits from the state's energy commission or from competing utilities. The city would then have to incur the cost of lengthy court proceedings at the end of which it would be forced to comply with the law. Topaz worked on the drafting of the provision in Sacramento.

Young old alike to be big users,Amy Diaz,Anaheim Bulletin,english,"Center will seek to provide services to all members of the public. But by its design, the center's biggest users will be senior citizens and children. The old senior center will close and all the senior activities move to the new center. The Boys and Girls Club of Anaheim, YMCA, the Anaheim Boxing Club and many of the city's youth sports programs will use the new gymnasium and fitness facilities. A group of children standing outside the gymnasium snacked on free cookies as the discussed the new building. They came in a bus as a group but would come back if they go the opportunity. All five had their faces painted with rainbows, aliens and other designs and said they were enjoying the grand opening celebrations. ""I've been to the YMCA once or twice,"" said Kimber Espen, 14. ""I would come again if I could get a ride."" She thinks that other youngsters would use the facilities at the new center, like the homework room, if they can get a ride. ""It gives (kids) something to do to stay out of trouble,"" she said. Her brother Matthew Espen, 11, was involved with the YMCA and karate and looks forward to come to activities at the new center. Christa Costa, 13, said she also wanted to be involved. Like Espen, she feels her involvement in the center will depend on how often she can find someone to drive her there. ""I signed up for karate and roller hockey,"" said Jordan Webb, 11. His mom volunteers for the city and often comes to the center. Echoing Kimber's thought's, Webb thinks the center will be good for children. ""If there's no community center, kids just hang around and tag stuff,"" he said. He likes the idea of a homework center with new computers. His younger brother, Jonathan Webb, 9, also is involved in roller hockey. In the assembly room, stragglers from the pancake breakfast discussed the new amenities for the senior center lone Ketterer hadn't seen all the new rooms in the center, but said the building looks great. She is involved in the Dapper Tappers and is excited about the new performing arts room. Evelyn Hickens, Dapper Tapper director, said the rooms ar e beautiful. Chris Jarvi, community services director, expects work to be finished and the center to be fully operational in about three weeks. A representative of state Sen. Rob Hurtt, R-Garden Grove, presented a certificate of recognition. One hundred members of the Loara High School Band played the national anthem. Members of the Anaheim Police Department color guard presented the flags. The Rev. Jimmy Gaston of the State College Church of Christ gave the invocation. Daly called the center a milestone for Anaheim. ""This is the first city gymnasium,"" he said. ""The senior center has the most attractive fireplace in Orange County. Thank you for all your ideas and suggestions as we put this package together. (We should) enjoy this building and keep it active, full of kids, full of seniors."" After the ceremonies, the public toured the building with members of the council and other city officials. Children clustered around the Disney characters. Though some younger children screamed in terror when the characters tried to talk to them, many older youngsters followed the characters throughout the rooms. In a tour of the gymnasium, Daly shot the first ceremonial basket on the court with a group of children. Activities and demonstrations continued throughout the day. In the lobby of the senior center, a senior choral group performed a selection of standards. Dance troupes, from ballet to the Dapper Tappers to line dancing, preformed in the assembly and arts rooms. Families attended a screening of ""Angels in the Outfield"" in the evening. Vendors and city organizations set up booths on a closed-off Philadelphia Street to sell T-shirts, provide safety information and hand out refreshments such as cookies, hot dogs and drinks.

"Guinn students get backpacks, supplies",Richard Manfredi,Anaheim Bulletin,english,"The two boys were comparing what was in their backpacks at Guinn Elementary School last Thursday. Their backpacks were filled with school supplies such as folders, writing tools and sheets of paper. ""I've got colored pencils and he didn't,"" said Ivan Anguiango, peering inside his bag. ""These are really cool."" ""Mine's green,"" said Ivan Jaimez. ""I like that color."" And so the two 9-year-olds discussed the state of their backpacks. Except it wasn't the first day of school. Classes had been taking place at this year-round school for several weeks, but this was the first day some students had the necessary equipment to learn. For the third year, Unity Community Church donated about 100 backpacks filled with school supplies to Guinn students whose families could not afford them. Most of the backpacks were handed out last Thursday, but some have been saved for students who are off-track. The main force behind the donations is Aleta Peters, Guinn's vice principal. She pitched the idea to the church membership, and said the congregation's response has been extremely positive ever since. ""Everyone at the church has 44 I can't imagine how a student could be expected to learn without the proper tools. CHUCK LEWIS Principal really backed this, and they're the ones that have made it successful,"" Peters said. So church members go shopping for backpacks and school supplies.

City honors Sally White with waterwise darden,Amy Diaz,Anaheim Bulletin,english,"The city honored long-time advocate for beautification Sally White by dedicating the waterwise garden at the Amtrak Metro linkstation in her honor. At a ceremony on Sept. 10, White's family and friends joined city dignitaries in praising her many years of community service with organizations such a s the Anaheim Arts Council, the Women's Division of the Anaheim Chamber of Commerce, the Anaheim Memorial Hospital project, the Anaheim Park s and Recreation Commission, the Orange County Harbors Beaches and Parks Commission, Anaheim Beautiful and Releaf Anaheim     organizations that White helped to f""Much of the beautification that's occurred in the city for the last 40 years is due to ... Sally White,"" said Mayor Tom Daly at the unveiling of a plaque in the garden. White, 85, has four children and six grandchildren with her husband of 56 years Joe. After the ceremony, White     a 45-year Anaheim resident     spoke to the Bulletin about her work in the community and importance of gettting- involved. How did you react when you heard about the dedication of garden? Alt was the most surprising and wonderful thing, the most gratifying thing that has ever happened to me . When I did all those things, I never had any thought of recognition. When I get involved in a project, I'm gung ho to get through it. It is something I will keep in my heart and the back of my mind forever. A For example, 10 years ago the city of Anaheim cut down all the trees on Broadway. I have never forgiven the city for that. I started Releaf Anaheim. We have planted at least 3,000 trees on city parkways. The hard part is finding these things and selling the ideas. The city is very cooperative. It has never given a fiat no to me I've ever asked for. What keeps community involvement going through out one years? A You have to keep after people. You have to persevere. You can't just start something and expect it to fall into place. I don't think there has ever been a project that has been an easy deal. But there is satisfaction when the project is completed. Getting the project done is the most important thing. Which of the many projects that you have been involved you consider your favorite? The Julianna Street Park is my baby. It's my first love. Releaf Anaheim is also very dear to me. When I stop and think about the project, they are all important. People do appreciate (the work you do) and people want to get involved. have you stayed in Anaheim all these years? AI loved Anaheim from the very beginning. After the children went to school, I became involved in organizations. I can't imagine leaving Anahem. It's home.",2000,17-Sep
"Guinn students get backpacks, supplies",Richard Manfredi,Anaheim Bulletin,english,"The two boys were comparing what was in their backpacks at Guinn Elementary School last Thursday. Their backpacks were filled with school supplies such as folders, writing tools and sheets of paper. ""I've got colored pencils and he didn't,"" said Ivan Anguiango, peering inside his bag. ""These are really cool."" ""Mine's green,"" said Ivan Jaimez. ""I like that color."" And so the two 9-year-olds discussed the state of their backpacks. Except it wasn't the first day of school. Classes had been taking place at this year-round school for several weeks, but this was the first day some students had the necessary equipment to learn. For the third year, Unity Community Church donated about 100 backpacks filled with school supplies to Guinn students whose families could not afford them. Most of the backpacks were handed out last Thursday, but some have been saved for students who are off-track. The main force behind the donations is Aleta Peters, Guinn's vice principal. She pitched the idea to the church membership, and said the congregation's response has been extremely positive ever since. ""Everyone at the church has 44 I can't imagine how a student could be expected to learn without the proper tools.

Limints,Amy Diaz,Anaheim Bulletin,english,"From page 1 1994 and, if elected, seek re-election in 1998, regardless of how long they had served on the council. The term-limit law states, in part: ""No person shall serve as Mayor or as a member of the City Council for a combined period of more than eight consecutive years. (Any person) shall again be eligible for election or appointment as Mayor or member of the City Council provided not less than two years has or will have elapsed."" The last clause of the term-limit law allows an exception to the eight-year limit for council members who were in office in 1992. ""Further, any member of the City Council, including the Mayor, in office on November 3,1992, and who would otherwise be ineligible to seek election to the office of Mayor in 1994 due to the operation of this section, shall be eligible for re-election to the office of Mayor in 1998, not withstanding any other provision of this section."" Daly, Ehrle, Pickler, Hunter and Bob Simpson were on the council at the time of the 1992 election. Ehrle lost his council re-election bid in 1992. Hunter and Pickler, who were ineligible to remain on the council, did not run for mayor in 1994. Simpson, who was eligible for a second council term, did not seek re-election or run for mayor. Before 1994, the mayor served two years and had to be a sitting City Council member. A 1991 charter amendment changed one of the five council seats to a four-year mayor's seat beginning with the 1994 election. That election was chosen because three council seats were on the 1994 ballot. The language of the term-limit law was discussed by council members for about six months / before the council voted on July 28,1992, to approve the final version that appeared on the ballot. Zemel, however, takes exception to Daly's re-election bid. Though he still believes the law was crafted for Daly's benefit, Zemel ""absolutely"" would have the same opposition to Hunter     a political ally at the time the law was written     or any of the other 1992 councilmen if they were in Daly'""(Daly) has every right to run but... I would argue that he is violating the spirit of the law,"" Zemel said. Daly said the clause was added with the consent of all but Pickler to put the members on a level playing field with respect to the newly established mayor's seat. Daly said he is a ""strong supporter of the (term-limit) measure"" who campaigned for the measure in 1992. ""If (Zemel) had opinions in 1992, he didn't express them during council meetings,"" Daly said. Zemel unsuccessfully ran for City Council in 1988 and 1992. He was a planning commissioner at the time the ballot measure was discussed. Daly defeated Hunter in the mayor's race in 1992, the same year he won re-election to the council. He was elected to the four-year mayor's seat in 1994.",2000,17-Sep
"Teen, mother need to break the cycle of emotional abuse",Tim Chapman,Anaheim Bulletin,english,"""Randi"" is a 16-year-old female. She lives with her mother and mother's boyfriend Dennis, who has lived with them for two years. Dennis ""molests"" Randi on a regular basis. There is no physical evidence of the abuse. That's because it's an emotional form of molestation. Emotional sexual abuse is rarely discussed or recognized as a damaging form of abuse. It is covert in nature and usually kept secret between the perpetrator and the victim. The victim can't report the abuse because there is usually no physical evidence of an assault. This abuse, however, is real and it is very damaging. Because of the covert nature of emotional molestation, Randi felt she was just imagining the abuse. And, when she would report it to her mother, she would also validate that ""it must be your imagination."" Dennis' emotional sexual abuse toward Randi has been displayed in the following ways: Voyeurism; Exhibitionism; Inappropriate emotional bonding (Dennis transfers adult emotional issues to Randi); Verbal assaults to her sexuality; and     Shaming gender messages received by the way Dennis treats Randi's mother. When Randi reported voyeurism to her mother about a year ago, she felt she was being watched by Dennis while she was in the shower and while dressing. Without physical evidence, however, her mother refused to believe her. Mom became angry at Randi, thinking Randi was making up the story because she didn't like Dennis. Randi felt sick and described fe""yuccy"" while being anywhere near Dennis. She also felt unsafe and unprotected by her mother. ""Dennis frequently walks around the house in the nude."" This exhibitionism is a violation of Randi's space and comfort zone. It is totally inappropriate. Randi remembers a time when her new boyfriend came to pick her up for a date. Dennis' fatherly advice was to ""keep your knees together."" When Randi's mother is not around, many times Dennis corners Randi for emotional advice and comfort. This puts her in an awkward position, or role that her mother should be playing. This form of abuse leads to enmeshment (smothering) relationships with others. In many cases when Dennis and Randi's mother are arguing, he makes verbally assaultive sexual comments. When Randi witnesses these assaults, she feels hurt and helpless for her mother. Randi also reports feeling guilty for not protecting her mother from Dennis' verbal assaults. What's really going on in this picture? Who's the real culprit? Randi's father is the original culprit here. He abandoned the family years ago, leaving mom responsible to raise Randi on her own. He neglected to protect his daughter. Today, Randi's mother is 100 percent responsible for staying in the relationship with Dennis and exposing her daughter to this sexual predator and refusing to believe her when she reports abuse. Randi's mother stays in the relationship because she feels it's better than the relationship she had with Randi's alcoholic father, in which he was physically abusive. Her intuition tells her ""something is wrong with this picture,"" even though she doesn't believe her daughter. Randi and her mother need to seek professional help to resolve their abuse and abandonment issues. These issues keep mother in this abusive relationship with Dennis. Subconsciously, mother stays with Dennis, ignoring Randi's pain, while fearing abandonment. Without professional help, Randi and her mother are ON THE LEVEL doomed to: Inappropriate emotional bonding with Dennis; An inability to recognize and protect themselves from abuse; and An inability to recognize or develop a healthy relationship. With professional help, Randi and her mother can: Break free of what attracts guys like Dennis; Set appropriate boundaries for themselves; and Find true intimacy with each other and break the cycle of abuse. Members of the Anaheim Branch of the American Association of University Women gathered at the Anaheim United Methodist Church on Saturday for brunch and a general meeting. Acting on the theme ""Community Spirit,"" branch members heard their Adopt-a-Social Worker Diane Wharton provide an update about teens and their children.

The Galerie Saxonia,Eleeza V. Agopian,Anaheim Bulletin,english,"It has the look and feel of a professional gallery.

City seeking members for boards commissions,Eleeza V. Agopian,Anaheim Bulletin,english,"If you were ever interested in getting involved in the community, now is the time to jump on that opportunity. The city recently announced openings on a number of boards and commissions. In this capacity, residents can offer their input and ideas on a wide variety of issues ranging from park planning to budget oversight. Qualified commissioners must be at least 18 years old and Anaheim residents. The City Council appoints the members to for four-year terms that begin on July 1. The groups make recommendations to the City Council on matters falling within their jurisdiction. Among the immediate openings now are two spots on the Parks and Recreation Commission and two on the Community Services Board.

""If you're volunteer-minded or if you have concern for people who are down on their luck, this is the board for you,"" he said. The amount of time residents dedicate is almost entirely up to them, Holmes said. It varies from attending weekly or biweekly meetings, to devoting a portion of each day to board work.

Mercy Housing of California's request to build 23 apartment units at 2761. W. Ball Road passed the Planning Commission unanimously on May 20 and next heads to the City Council. Mercy officials say they plan to ask the council for a $345,000 loan     approximately $15,000 per unit     to foot the construction bill. Mercy will make its reque""We're hoping this is our final hurdle on our way to getting tax credits,"" said Dara Kovel, Mercy regional director. She added that city officials have so far reacted positively to their request. Councilwoman Lucille Kring said that although she has not yet seen the final proposal, it seemed like an important project to be included in Anaheim. But, she said she would have to wait and see how it serves the community. ""The quality of the management will determine the quality of the product,"" she said. West Anaheim activists, who typically oppose new apartments at their end of town, wholeheartedly support this proposal. ""Our land use people were all completely in favor of it because it's a necessary item,"" said Esther Wallace, chairwoman of the West Anaheim Neighborhood Development Council. ""We feel in our community we should have a balance among the different types of housing."" Kovel said the need for such affordable housing in Anaheim is evident. The organization has already received more than 100 requests for the 22 studio apartments. The 23rd apartment is a two-bedroom unit for the manager. ""Market-driven housing isn't building housing for people at those income levels,"" Kovel said. Qualified residents would earn half the median income of the area, as determined by the federal Department of Housing and Urban Development. Some of the services provided to future residents would include transportation assistance, job training and placement or counseling. The organization purchased the property on West Ball Road last June and began the planning stages of the project, including gathering community input. Kovel said they first went to WAND because of its influential role on development in West Anaheim. ""There was a clear recognition that this is a disease that doesn't discriminate,"" she said. The project borders Dale Junior High School on its north end, apartments on the east and west, and faces Ball Road to the south. Mercy started construction on a senior housing complex at 2240 W.

Yorba Linda seeking to annex soundwall area,Diane Reed,Anaheim Bulletin,english,"The planned annexation of 140 acres of unincorporated county territory abutting Anaheim Hills would, if approved, place all of the proposed railroad sound-absorbing wall within the Yorba Linda city limits. Yorba Linda sued late last year, halting construction of the soundwall that been slated to start on Jan. 2. Both cities are still waiting for a judge to rule on the suit. In the meantime, Yorba Linda has proposed annexing the county islands known as the Country Club and Fairlynn neighborhoods. Fairlynn is adjacent to Anaheim Hills and includes about 25 percent of the area where the soundwall is to be built. Documents describing the Fairlynn annexation area state the project area is ""north of Esperanza Road."" That description was inaccurate.

High School and South Junior High School. The district's top priority is to build an auditorium at Kennedy High School, Lamer said. Currently, all 24 schools use Anaheim High School's Cook Auditorium. Kennedy's auditorium will serve the western part of the district, while Anaheim's facility will serve the eastern part of the district. The new auditorium will house 600 patrons. Larner said the district will submit design plans for state approval in the fall. Suzanne McElderry, Kennedy's vocal music department chairwoman, said the auditorium will revolutionize the school's music program. It pro vides classroom space for the school's 400 choir members and 250 band members. It also gives students a safe, permanent performing venue. Choir and band performances are now held at Anaheim High School or Walker Junior High School. ""We're very excited,"" she said. ""In the past, we had no place on campus to perform. This gives us the opportunity to actually rehearse in the same hall that we're performing in."" The Measure Z Citizen's Oversight Committee will oversee bond proceeds, expenses and projects.

District representatives met with bond rating agencies a few weeks ago to secure a credit rating. District spokeswoman Suzi Brown said the district should receive its rating in mid-June. Bonds will be issued soon after the district receives its rating. Measure BB provides funding for a variety of construction and modernization projects. All district schools will be renovated. Construction will occur at 11 sites. The district's top priority is to build two side-by-side schools at 1000 S. Harbor Blvd., near Harbor Boulevard and Ball Road. The schools will share a library, multipurpose room and playfield. Resident Jesus Ramirez, 60, said he doesn't mind paying extra property taxes to fund the proposed project.",2001,06-Jun

Fire safety,CHIEF ROGER SMITH,Anaheim Bulletin,english,"In January, a new California law went into effect that prohibits leaving children younger than age 6 unattended in vehicles. The law, known as ""Kaitlyn's Law,"" was named after a 6-month-old Riverside girl died one hot summer day after accidentally being left inside a car by her babysitter. The law is intended to prevent other young children from suffering in a similar tragedy. National estimates state that between 1996 and 2000, at least 120 children died from heat stroke after being left behind in a parked car either by a parent or a caregiver. In some cases, adults left children in vehicles either knowingly or unknowingly. ACTING CHIEF ROGER SMITH Others occurred when a child crawled into an unlocked car while playing and became trapped inside. Many parents and caregivers are simply not aware of the risk. Extreme heat affects infants and small children disproportionately. When left inside a hot vehicle, a child's core body temperature can increase three to five times faster than that of an adult. Even with the window open slightly, if the outside temperature is 93 degrees Fahrenheit, the temperature inside a car can exceed 125 degrees in only 20 minutes. A car is not a toy, a playground or a babysitter! Never leave your child unattended in a car even for a few minutes. It can be fatal. SAFETY TIPS On days that seem almost mild as well as hot summer days parents need to be vigilant about their children's safety in and around a car. ",2001,06-Jun

Adelphia airs show on pool safety,Karlie Reiss,Anaheim Bulletin,english,"The Anaheim Fire Department has teamed up with the Police Department and Adelphia Communications to produce a Spanish-language television program on drowning prevention. The program is in response to three incidents in July in which two Hispanic children drowned. ""La Temporada del los Ahogamientos"" is hosted by community leader Jose Vargas and draws from the local knowlegde of Maria Sabol, Fire Department spokeswoman, and Sgt. Mike Hildago, police community affairs officer. ""Little Mexican kids are not as familiar as other kids around swimming pools,"" Vargas said. ""This is one of the reasons for the causalities. We wanted to do something good, and we just are educating the people, that's all."" The program will run on the cable access channel throughout the month. Adelphia newscaster Linda Nofer came up with the idea after searching for a reason for the three incidents last month. A two-year-old Spanish-language video produced by the Children's Hospital of Orange County is the only other production that reaches out to the area's Hispanic community. On the Adelphia program, Sabol uses her time to highlight reasons for drownings. She has worked with the Orange County Drowning Prevention Network in promoting education and pool safety. She also makes presentations at community events such as the Lions Club meetings and Mommy and Me swim lessons. Sabol said children five or younger are targeted for the education efforts because drownings are the leading cause of death in that age group. ''La Temporada del los Ahogamient05"" will air this month throughout Adelphia's service area. Channels, days and times vary according to city. Anaheim and Villa Park: 6 and 7:30 p.m. Thursdays, Channel 3 Yorba Linda: 6 and 7:30 p.m. Thursdays, Channel 35a Brea, La Habra and La Habra Heights: 4 and 9 p.m. Fridays, Saturdays and Sundays, Channel 48 ""We have been thinking of ways that we can reach out to the community as a whole,"" Sabol said. ""This is a way we can fc- Buena Park, Newport Beach and Placentia: 5 p.m. Fridays, Channel 3 Fullerton: 5 p.m. Fridays, Channel 53 Santa Ana: 4:30 and 9:30 p.m. Mondays, Channel 53 Buena Park: 4:30 and 9:30 p.m. Mondays, Channel 55 Fullerton and Placentia: 4:30 and 9:30 p.m. get out message to everybody."" The Fire Department has produced a flyer that features drowning prevention safety tips in both English and Spanish Hildago reminds viewers of Anaheim's laws on swimming pool access. Every pool in Anaheim is required to have a five-foot fence or wall or an adult supervisor once they reach 18 inches deep. The law also requires recirculation and purification systems to be working. Residents who don't comply with the law will have 48 hours to fix the violation or be cited. ""I believe this segment was necessary to reach a part of the audience,"" Hildago said.",2002,15-Aug
Four qualify in election for mayor,Karlie Reiss,Anaheim Bulletin,english,"Four candidates have qualified for the Nov. 5 ballot to replace Mayor Tom Daly, whose term expires at the end of the year. Daly is unable to run because of term limits. The candidates who have qualified for the ballot are Councilman Frank Feldhaus, Councilwoman Lucille Kring, former assemblyman Curt Pringle and former La Habra police chief Steve Staveley. Businessman George Nielsen has been disqualified. City Clerk Sheryll Schroeder said Nielsen, who filed his paperwork on Friday, submitted 21 signatures on the nominating petition.

Helping Hands grants awarded,Bobby Gilmore,Anaheim Bulletin,english,"Every now and then, people need a helping hand. For Anaheim residents, the Helping Hands program is just that - a way to help people make it through the tough times. Helping Hands raised $44,000 in donations to distribute to various nonprofit organizations during the fiscal year that ran from July 1, 2001, through June 30, 2002. The program gives residents an opportunity to make a tax-deductible donation with the payment of their bi-monthly utility bills. Donations are to help low-income residents with one-time utility bill payments, provide scholarships and give seniors in-home assistance. This year, 20 community organizations received grants that were handed out through a competitive process. Funding went to organizations that focused on Anaheim residents and demonstrated how they improved the lives of residents. The board also took into consideration proposals that addressed at-risk youth or seniors. The Feedback Foundation, one of two $5,000 recipients, provides services for stay-at-home seniors. Ret Wixted, executive director, said the program provides hot meals to 850 seniors at 22 sites throughout Anaheim. ""These folks would be in serious trouble without the Helping Hands program,"" Wixted said. ""The money allows us to bring a volunteer into the home to assist with their [elders] needs."" Wixted said most of the seniors want to be independent and their program is doing their best to make that possible. ""Our main focus is that our grant recipents are truly helping the city of Anaheim,"" said Dawn Miller, Board member at the Helping Hands program. The Boys and Girls Club of Anaheim also received $5,000. Michael Baker, the club's Anaheim director, said the organization will use the money for its Motel Outreach program. ""We assist 28 low-income families living in motels and take them to our facility free of charge,"" Baker said. Baker said this is the largest grant the club has received from the Helping Hands program and credits it to the club's commitment to serve low-income youth. ""Helping Hands realizes the impact of our program,"" Baker said. ""Nobody is doing what we're doing."" ABOUT THE PROGRAM Helping Hands was started in 19S6. The program offers Anaheim Public Utilities Department customers the opportunity to make tax-deductible donations three times a year with their utility bills. The Anaheim Community Foundation distributes the money collected. ",2002,15-Aug
"Students from Anaheim's sister city Mito, Japan, immerse themselves in language and culture",Eleeza V. Agopian,Anaheim Bulletin,english,"Big very big. That's what the 20 students from Mito, Japan     Anaheim's sister city     had to say about their impressions of America and American life at the end of their two-week stay in this city. The group of 16 girls, four boys and their teacher lived with 11 host families in Anaheim and Anaheim Hills. The group included 10 high school students and 10 college students. All of the scholars have spent at least six years studying English and came here to practice then- language skills, learn firsthand about American culture, and, of course, take in some sun at the beach and do some shopping. Their weekday itinerary included lessons in language and conversation, history, culture (such as traditions and holiday), and outings to local museums. The students spent weekends with their host families, who planned individual trips to Sea World, the Getty Center, and hosted barbecues. Marne Colby, a 27-year-old second-grade teacher in Buena Park, served as the Japanese students' instructor for their two ays, however, that she felt more like their friend and hopes to plan her own trip to Japan soon. ""I felt more like their friend, than their teacher,"" she said. Mutsumi Hosoya, an English-language teacher at a junior high school in Mito, accompanied the students on their journey and also stayed with a host family. She said the students quickly found their footing in America despite some initial anxiety about being immersed in a new culture. In the end, she says, Japan and America are not so different. ""Japan is now a copy of America,"" Hosoya says of trends and values in the two countries. But the two countries are not so similar that the students were left unimpressed by American culture. Several students said they were surprised to see the diverse makeup of America's demographics. ""There are many ethnic people, it doesn't matter,"" Rie Suzuki said. ""Asian people, black people, white people; all mixed."" The 19-year-old studies American and English literature at Ibaraki Christian University and said she wants to learn more about American culture. Others put a lot of weight     figuratively, not literally     in the role food plays in American culture. The size of it, the variety of restaurants, and even Americans' take on sushi. Yuji Kanazawa, a 16-year-old high school student, said he liked California rolls, sushi stuffed with crab and avocado, although it would be considered an oddity in Japan. Others were overwhelmed by the size of traditional American fare such as burgers, steaks, and ""Japanese food and American food are so different,"" Suzuki said. ""Japanese treasure food. American food is a lot, very big. If people leave food, they throw it away."" Yoko Miyazaki, a 21-year-old French literature major at Aoyamagakuin University, said she was most impressed by the array of cuisines available. Although there is some variety in Japan, she said it does not compare to American restaurants. Twenty students from Mito, Mito, Japan, Anaheim's sister city, spent two weeks here.

Eichler announces candidacy for City Council,Eleeza V.

The West Anaheim resident is a self-published author and says he expects his second, as yet untitled, book     outlining his thoughts on the political direction the country is taking     to be 'released by a publishing 'house in the fall. He is ""From Rags to Royalty"" examines his own spiritual journey. The following are some of his thoughts in his first bid for public office: Q: Why are you running for City Council? A: ""Well, there's several reasons. I believe Anaheim needs to go in a new direction, butwithout sacrificing , our old-and' standard values. I see Sorrietroubling things in Anaheim and I have based my platform on five points. ""First of all, we need to teach our children. What does that mean? You're familiar with the events in the past several months of abductions and kidnappings. This is tragic. We don't ever want that to happen in Anaheim. ""Second of all, we need to be able to teach English to all of our students in school. Our law books, our constitution, our whole society is based on English. We need to teach     English without sacrificing the culture of our students. So, if somebody has a strong cultural background, we don't want them to lose that cultural background, but they need to speak Eng""The (third) thing we need to do, and what I want to do, I want to be able to have protected neighborhoods. Because of the increased traffic on Beach Boulevard, Harbor and so forth, there are some neighborhoods right off Harbor Boulevard     where I live is right off Harbor     we need to be able to have a classification of a neighborhood that's protected. What that means is it's not a standard neighborhood because of the traffic pattern, but a neighborhood that needs a little bit more attention. Example: parking, speed bumps, possible study on the traffic flow to create some cui de sacs so there's not so much drive-""The (fourth) thing I want to be able to bring forth is I want to restructure the business license fee. Right now for retail, wholesale, and also manufacturing it is $60 for the fee, $27 for the processing fee, and then it's I think 9.5 percent per thousand on gross receipts. We need to eliminate that     eliminate that     just have a nominal fee for businesses that do less than $500,000 in gros""Why do we want to do that? Because we have to attract small businesses to Anaheim so our employment will go up. ""The (fifth) thing I want to do in Anaheim is I want to be able to direct the city in a couple of ways. There is a real problem that I see developing. It's hard to express because it's a difficult problem that meets to the very heart of people. I want to endorse our police department and we endorse our police department by a couple of ways. ""First of all the mess     and I'm going to use the word mess     the mess that's happening down here at City Hall is atrocious and insulting to the city. That mess is that there seems to be a tremendous amount of anger, frustration, hostility in several groups within Anaheim. One of the groups is a small fragment of the Hispanic""Now my wife is Hispanic and I cannot believe that the tens of thousands of wonderful Hispanic people here in Anaheim, and the thousands of Hispanic business owners, and the people that are here that pledge allegiance to our flag, the people that are here that have served in our military, wants Anaheim to turn into a place that's controlled by illegal aliens. I don't believe that. ""We need to define and say wait a minute, this is not really a Hispanic problem, this is a problem of the city of Anaheim and being able to handle the illegal aliens that are coming here. They're coming here illegally and we have to be able to process them. ""And we have to be able to return them back to Mexico or return them back to China or Canada, wherever they come from. But the majority of them are people from Mexico."" Q: What would you do to improve the city if you are elected? A: ""We need to grow more as a theme. We don't want to be just the city that hosts Disneyland.We want people to come here and live it up in Anaheim. We want people to spend money, enjoy themselves, and maybe move here. We have everything but beachfront property to offer people. ""We would have to develop more of a theme for the city, more of a fun theme. We should live it up in Anaheim. We should encourage people to come here and not just promote one or two attractions, but many things. ""Q: What do you see as the key issues in the race? A: ""There's some zoning difficulties and I do have to do some more research on this. The zoning issue down at the Beach and Lincoln area; there's a western police station that's being discussed now and there's talk of the gymnasium and rezoning. One issue that I want the people of Anaheim to know, it's this: The whole city has to respect property rights. ""I don't want to happen over there at Beach and Lincoln what happened in Cypress. What happened in Cypress is a church is losing it's property, where a city has come out and said we're taking your property because we're going to put a Costco there. We don't ever want to be in a position of putting the city in a negative light and putting these people in a horrible situation. ""Look, it's real simple. When somebody goes out and develops a piece of real estate, they look at highest and best use. We wouldn't put a daily across from Anaheim Stadium, you wouldn't put a used car lot across from Disneyland. Highest and best use. ""Well, highest and best use can be measured by many things, including traffic and cost per square foot. But there's many considerations. When a city goes out and says the highest and best use for this piece of property is the tax revenue it will generate, they are blind, B-L-I-N-D. They're blind because they don't consider the complete picture."" Q: How have you been active in the community? A: ""There's several ways. I have spoken in front of Anaheim City Council I didn't even know how many times; over a dozen times. I have worked with some of the other individuals who have run for offices not only here, for Congress, but also for the city. And, I'm land of behind the scenes, and I haven't really come forward in more of a public light like I am now. ""My activity in the city has been setting the stage for me to be able to step forward and say, 'I can do this.""' Q: What are your community affiliations? A: ""I'm the vice president of ACRU, American Civil Responsibilities Union, where your benefits as a citizen ""ACRU."" We have a cable show, Adelphia Channel 3, comes on Monday nights at 6:30. Dr. Howard Garber is the president and founder of that and I'm the vice president. We are anticipating nonprofit status within the next 30 days.

Anaheim student studying HIV virus,Karlie Reiss,Anaheim Bulletin,english,"University of California, Irvine researchers got back two weeks ago from the 14th annual International AIDS conference in Spain. They were there to present research on the HIV protein integrase. While they were away, 16 year-old Teresa Chau Nguyen was working alongside graduate students in their grant-funded laboratory. During this time, she passed her driver's test but was already in the driver's seat of cutting-edge AIDS research. Nguyen was a participant in the American Cancer Society's Youth Science Fellowship Program, which allows nine Orange County high school students to spend six weeks of their summer in a hands-on learning environment. Nguyen teamed up with third-year molecular biology graduate student Debrah Lee for six weeks to learn about her integrase research. ""Studying proteins is essential for a virus replication,"" Nguyen said. ""Currently there is no drug on the market that targets the integrase protein."" She said it tool a while to calm her nerves before being able to follow along. ""We are expressing integrase protein from genes derived from patients who have HIV,"" she said. ""At first they were talking about all of these big words that I didn't know what they meant. But those words are just normal now."" Nguyen's research is focused on integrase because the other three proteins essential to replicate to contain HIV already have drugs available. ""The two other protein's drugs are what make up the AIDS cocktail which you might have seen advertised on TV,"" Lee said. The lab works with three HIV samples. One is from Rwanda, the other is from North America and the third is considered a wild card, or unknown patient. ""It's been a long time since I've talked to someone who is 16,"" said Raffy Dakessian, program coordinator. ""It's good for us graduate students to hear the public perception of science. The level that they are at is definitely different than the level that the mentors are at and we act as a bridge."" Nguyen is not allowed to throw on a lab coat, goggles and gloves to get an up-close look at the HIV virus. In this aspect they realize that she is still just a high school student and the liability factor comes into view. ""The amount of material can be daunting,"" Dakessian said. ""Everything was over the students' heads at first, but it comes down to how you deal with it. You have to think abstractly, and learn how to sort through information."" Although the research is strictly medical, Nguyen has become more familial' with the virus as a whole. ""I know what HIV patients are going through and how difficult it must be for them and their family because now I know exactly what the virus is like,"" she said. Community service is promoted at Nguyen's high school, Oxford Academy in Cypress, an Anaheim Union High School District college preparatory campus. ""There are two paths that you must choose from in your first year at the school,"" Nguyen said. ""It's between business and medical and I have wanted to be a doctor since I was little."" Nguyen said there are more females involved in her school's medical program than males. ""I think this is because women like to take care of people,"" she said. ""And you know men, they want to make money."" Nguyen plans to continue to study medicine at UCI or University of California, Santa Barbara. ""The misconception is that science is hard,"" Raffy said. ""What we do on a day-to-day basis, like mixing two liquids together, is not difficult. What is complicated is explaining the rationale behind it. """,2002,15-Aug
Bond between parents student and teacher critical,Lorena Alvarez,Anaheim Bulletin,english,"I can hardly believe that the school year is off and running. In my last column, I mentioned that the best ways to start off the year is to get to know your child's teacher. Hopefully, you are busy building a relationship with him or her. As a teacher, I have been busy getting to know my students and their families. I have returned to the days of visiting my students in their homes and seeing for myself how they live and interact at home. It is always a wonderful learning experience and the best way I have found is to build a foundation at the beginning of the year. A good relationship between a family and the school is really the most basic ingredient to a successful year. It is just a simple question of time. Unfortunately, with the daily demands of families and teachers it is rare to have any extra time. So I firmly believe like most things in life you have to make the time. Traditionally we, as parents and educators, see separate and distinct worlds when it comes to children. It is almost as if they were breathing air in one place and underwater with gills in another. If we could combine our efforts between home and schools, we would win half of the battle. Sometimes I think we forget that we are on the same team. How hard is it to remind ourselves that we both want to support the success of the same child? If the relationship is established and the lines of communication are open, we will be able to depend on each other when we need the support. Just last week, I had to call a parent in and unfortunately I had never met the family. I felt awkward and can only imagine how the parent felt coming to see me for a behavior issue when we had never been introduced or had a friendly conversation. On the other hand, when I had a problem with a family that I have already had the opportunity to meet and talk with, I felt comfortable calling mom and asking her to come in and talk with me. It wasn't stressful and had a very positive outcome, despite the nature of the meeting. The best example I can give you for establishing the relationship is the sense of community it creates. It's like the proverb it take a village to raise a child. I don't know that it takes a whole village but I do know that it takes more than one person. Everyone's job becomes easier when there is an established relationship. I feel confident that many of my parents will feel more comfortable to come to me with questions, or information that will help me to support his learning at school. I have a mother in my class who I speak to regularly and her son has had a difficult time with the new math concepts that we are working on. She has come to me several times to ask for help because she is having a hard time helping her son with the homework. I now make a conscious effort to watch her son in math and when I know that he is struggling with the day's lesson I modify the homework for him and give his mom a copy. I know you might be thinking why don't I don't automatically do that for all my students. And I do make modifications in my plans and reteach. For several students I send home modified homework. Not all parents, however, show that they really care nor do they take the time to communicate with me. I can only do so much by myself, when I have 20 students I need to teach. As a teacher, I want to know parents care and as a parent I would want to know that teacher cares about my child. How will this happen if no communication is established? What I struggle with is who should initiate the open lines of communication. As a teacher I try to take the initiative. It is worth the effort and it makes the rest of the year easier for me. However, when I think of my daughter and the years ahead, I wonder if I will do what most parents do - wait. Parents wait, maybe even hold their breath, hoping that they won't receive a call from school. I refuse to be one of those parents! I am a proud parent and want everyone to know it. And if you are my child is teacher. I want you to know how wonderful she is - a handful but wonderful! I would enjoy hearing about the relationships that have been built between you and your children's school. I would be curious to know if any parents have initiated the conversations and how they were received. If you invited your child's ^ teacher to your home for a friendly conversation, do you think they would accept?

Choosing the right food for your pet important to health,Roger Bierstedf,Anaheim Bulletin,english,"There are days when things are slow I really enjoy stirring up a can of worms by getting into a discussion about what is the best food for my pet. First, let's think about the pet's gastrointestinal tract. This is an organ that has evolved over thousands of years and is well adapted to eat about anything. Dogs and cats are hunters. ""Are they meat eaters? Yes and no. Actually, they are omnivorous meaning they eat both meat and plant material. Their main source of protein is generally meat in origin but plant fiber is absolutely essential for normal digestion and bowel motility. It's only in the last half century that we have started to feed our pets commercially prepared diets that are supposedly and hopefully digestible and well balanced from a protein, fat, carbohydrate, and fiber standpoint. ASK DR. B It's interesting that we expect the animal's gastrointestinal tract to suddenly adapt in an evolutionary blink of the eye to commercial colorings, stabilizers, fillers, preservatives, and whatever else those things on the label are. Surprisingly, they do a very good job of it. So, back to the question ""What's the best food for my pet?"" Strictly speaking, most commercial foods are more than adequate. Remember a few simple guidelines. Does my pet like it? Does he or she have a nice healthy shiny coat? Is my pet over or underweight? Does the food make my dog or cat vomit or have loose stools? While not as noticeable in cats and small dogs, probably the most important criteria I, use to evaluate the quality of a, pet food, is how much stool . Does my pet produce based on how much I feed. While price is definitely a compelling reason to buy a certain brand, cheaper is not necessarily better. Remember, if you feed a large breed 50 pounds of food a month, but are picking up 25 pounds of stool, that food is only 50 percent digestible. And, if that 50 pounds of food costs $40, you're throwing $20 a month in the trash. Compare that to 50 pounds of food that costs $55 and has a 75 percent biological equivalent or digestibility value. You'll feed 25 percent less and save about $7.25 per month and you'll be picking up fewer stools. Is one brand better for my pet? Ethically, I can't recommend one brand over another. We sell a couple brands at my hospital that we consider to be premium foods, based on their digestibility and palatability. They produce less stools, and are considered by most of, my pet owners as being very palatable and well tolerated by their pets. Most veterinarians sell what they consider to be a premium diet based on the same criteria and their experience with feeding a certain brand over time. Would my pet benefit from a prescription diet? Several pet food manufacturers make prescription diets that address specific health problems such as diabetes, kidney and liver disease, heart failure, obesity and a whole list of gastrointestinal disorders. This column is too short to discuss each of them and if your pet has one of the above problems, discuss it with your veterinarian. Many of these diets are definitely beneficial in the management of certain diseases, and most are palatable enough that your pet will eat them. One of the most common questions I get is ""Will changing my pet's food stop it from itching?"" The answer is probably not., , , Food allergies in cats are extremely rare, extremely difficult to manage and generally non-responsive to changing to another commercial diet. Dogs can experience food allergies. Food can play a role in allergies, but most allergies in dogs are multi-factorial and rarely attributable to food alone. While clients often relate to me their dog improved by eliminating corn in their pet's diet, it's strongly possible it was coincidental. The hallmark of food allergies is that they are non-seasonal, itching lasts year round and are only partially responsive to medication. Almost every commercial diet contains proteins that can cause allergies including beef, pork, chicken, lamb, wheat, corn, soy, barley, daily by-products. The list is endless. Allergies are caused by repeated exposure to a foreign protein and an abnormal immune response to that protein. , It has been discovered that in, order for a protein to cause an , Please?

Anaheim mourns officer killed in Iraq,Eleeza V. Agopian,Anaheim Bulletin,english,"Anaheim police officers mourned the loss of one of their own Monday when they received word reserve officer Edward Smith, a 1st sergeant in the Marine Corps, was killed in fighting outside SMITH Basra, Iraq. City flags are flying at half-staff this week to honor Smith, 38, who joined Anaheim's reserve ranks in 1999. Smith had hoped to retire from the military this summer and spend the rest of his professional career with the Anaheim Police Department. But all military retirements were cancelled and Smith was sent to the Middle East. Sgt. Greg Palmer, president of the Anaheim Police Association.   Smith as respectful and confide"" He was a good reserve officer, he was a good Marine,"" he said. ""And he was a good husband and a good father."" Smith leaves behind his wife Sandy and their three children, Nathan, 12, Ryan, 9 and Shelby, 8. The family lives in Vista, near Camp Pendleton. He was deployed with the 2nd Tank BattaUon, Fox Company, 1st Marine Expeditionary Force, with whom he led a company of more than 200 Marines. He was killed in a firefight outside Basra on Friday, where he died of a head wound, according to Marine officials. A decorated reserve officer. Smith was named ""Top Cop"" from his graduating class in the Palomar Police Academy. He also was named Reserve Rookie of the Year for the in 2000 and the Orange County Reserve Officer of the Year in 2001. Smith also received honors in his 20-plus years as a Marine, including the Navy Commendation Medal, two Navy Achievement medals and the Honor Graduate award from his non-commissioned officer training course. Officer Bill Moss in the department's community polio- member him as verying division said officers re- professional policeman. ""He was just a very hard-working man,"" he said. Sgt.

Overcoming grim past,Olivia Maciel,Anaheim Bulletin,english,"Her grim past and her bright future are packages that seem to have come together in Veronica Hinojosa's life. Despite her mother's mental illness and father's incarceration, Hinojosa remains the top student inlier class with a 4.44 cumulative GPA. Hinojosa, 18, is the oldest of five children. At the age of 10, Hinojosa took on adult responsibilities - taking care of her siblings, washing clothes and dishes and bathing her mother after an accident left her mother's left side paralyzed. ""I remember that day (of the accident) clearly,"" said Hinojosa, who was nine at the time. ""We were in the car while my parents were argum and my mom was screaming and threatened to throw herself out of the car,"" Hinojosa said. ""She did jump out. All I remember is her body dragging from her left side."" ""My dad stopped the car and the paramedics came,"" Hinojosa said. ""She was full of blood."" Her mother was hospitalized and was in a coma for six months. Hinojosa realized that those actions were early signs of her mother's mental instability. At the time, her father didn't know what to do. Her mother eventually came out of the coma, but her mental instability worsened. Hinmosa's life seemed to have gotten worse. When she was 12, her father was incarcerated for drug trafficking. ""My mom had terrible mood swings,"" Hinojosa said. ""When my dad called from jail, my mom was outraged,"" Hinojosa said. From that point, her mother began threatening her children. ""She called the police to take us in,"" Hinojosa said. ""She would tell them, 'You took my husband. Take my children too.'"" Hinojosa said her mother even the police to tell them she was going to kill them. Eventually, Hinojosa and her siblings were taken from her mother and placed in different foster homes. After sometime, an aunt decided to take in Hinojosa and her siblings. Hinojosa still has fond memories of her father, because he was a ""loving father"" and still visits him in jail. Hinojosa's relationship with her mother is almost non-existent. Although Hinojosa said she now understands why her mother was not affectionate and not ""motherly,"" their relationship is not the same. ""I used to resent her, but I don't anymore,"" Hinojosa said. ""I understand why she wasn't good to us."" ""I still visit her once in a while not because I need her, but because I know it's good for her."" Hinojosa said - Despite Hinojosa's personal problems, John Dahlem the principal at her school, which is not being identified because Hinojosa and her siblings do not want to be located by their mother, said that throughout his 27 years in education he has never come across a student like Hinojosa. ""On one side, you have this girl who is at the top of her class. She's an exceptional student with advance placement classes and a very pleasant demeanor,"" Dahlem said. ""But then you also have this girl who has been through so much. And yet, she's very resilient,"" Dahlem said. Hinojosa remains active in school activities. She has been a member of the basketball and track teams. She's in advanced placement classes and is currently enrolled in Junior Reserve Officer's Training Corps. Hinojosa said that her involvement in school was an escape from her personal life. Ironically, however, that drive was instiled by her father, ""My dad always told me that I could be good in whatever I wanted to do, "" Hinojosa said. Dahlem first encountered Hinojosa when a JROTC teacher recommended Hinojosa to write an essay for ""Every Student Succeeding,"" from the Association of California School Administrators. ""She (Veronica) does not look for pity,"" Dahlem said. ""If it weren't for this personal essay and JROTC instructor, I would have never known this about her."" Hinojosa was chosen by Dahlem to participate in the awards ceremony. Hinojosa was one of the 13 participants to win an award from the local high schools. Hinojosa was chosen to represent Orange County at the national level, Dahlem said. Hinojosa maintains a positive outlook in life. She has applied to several universities, including UCLA and USC, and has been accepted by both. She has yet to hear from Stanford. ""I see this (problems) as, God didn't put anything in my path that I couldn't handle,"" Hinojosa said. ",2003,10-Apr
Nurse who needs kidney promotes organ donations,Diane Reed,Anaheim Bulletin,english,"Jeanne Sisneros has a simple message and she's taking it to the streets. ""Recycle yourself,"" her license plate frame says. ""Be an organ donor."" Sisneros, 48, also has a personalized plate that reads ""INDKDW (I need a kidney). Although people often think it is a scrambled Donna Karan or DKNY reference, she says it still serves its purpose - to start people talking about organ donation. A registered nurse at Kaiser Permanente Hospital in Anaheim Hills, Sisneros suffers from focal segmental glomerular sclerosis, a rare kidney disease. There is no history of this disease in her family, she said. Although she had had kidney problems for 11 years, Sisneros was shocked to find out that the severe leg cramps that sent her to an urgent care clinic one night in 1998 were a sign of renal failure. Now, in addition to working full time at the hospital, Sisneros goes to dialysis three times a week. ""I can see how sick they can be,"" she said. ""I wonder if that will be me some day."" In the meantime, she does what she can to show them that dialysis is a beginning and not the end of life, as they've known it. ""They can see that I'm living a full and productive life,"" she said. ""It gives them hope."" Sisneros decided to go public with her journey from kidney failure to transplantation in order to promote National Donate Life Month. ""I always hoped someone would offer (a kidney) to me, or I would just jump to the top of the list. But, it isn't that easy,"" she said. Although the- class has adopted the 1,(300 members of 173rd Airborne Brigade, their help is not limited only to that unit. ""We've also prepared packages for other students who came into our classroom to ask if we could send packages to people they know,"" McMillan said. McMillan's classroom now looks like a mini-market. Boxes of crackers, cookies, hard-candy and other items her students have chosen for the troops are piled up in the corner. ""The items they've chosen seem more like items they would like for themselves,"" McMillan said, but that is also part of the project. McMillan has also made sure to make the project part of her regular lesson plan by including mobility exercises, history and English lessons and other topics. ""When we purchased the items, we took a bus ride to the local market,"" McMillan said. ""Our next trip will be to the post office."" Although some of her students did enjoy the trip to the market, students like Amanda Bradan enjoy the academic part of the project as well. ""I like writing to the troops because we get to know them and they get to know us,"" Bradan said. McMillan also has included research assignments requiring her students to go online and research the origins of the 173rd Airborne Brigade. ""The students thought that if the troops ran out of toilet paper, they could use newspaper instead,"" McMillan said. ""It didn't occur to them that there are no newspapers in the middle of the desert."" The small care packages are sent every other day because the troops are limited to 13 ounces, which is deemed an appropriate weight that can fit in a backpack. Larger packages are sent every two weeks. Rhonda Buchanan, an in structionalaide who is also involved in the project, said the support from the community has been incredible. Recently, her dentist donated dental floss, toothbrushes and toothpaste. McMillan's family podiatrist has donated foot powder and ointment for calluses and blisters. Although the items they have stocked are enough to last through the school year, monetary support is still lacking. Currently McMillan and Buchanan pay postage for the items they send overseas. The students, who have needs of their own, are very proud of their efforts. ""I guess I'm doing this to return the favor because it takes a lot of courage to do what they (the troops) do,"" said Tony Daeschner, 13.",2003,10-Apr

"Good parents come in all shapes, sizes and colors",Lorena Alvarez,Anaheim Bulletin,english,"Single parenting is a subject that hits very close to home because something that many people don't know about me is that I am a single parent. I am not ashamed nor do not feel that it makes me less of a parent or Julianna less of a daughter. Quite the contrary, I feel like, ""WOW someone really wanted this child, what a lucky child!"" And, honestly, I am the lucky one. Julianna was custom made to fit me, my interest and lifestyle. It's like looking in a mirror and listening to myself 30 years ago. Traditionally, we have been led to believe that children need a two-parent household to be raised properly and I whole-heartedly disagree. What children need are active parents who are good role models. Research shows that in the end all you really need is at least one good parent (or adult model) to make it. In two-parent households, children can get lost in the fa  ade that both parents are present but reality is that they are not actively participating or in many cases parenting. My experience is that many times children get lost in the shuff""Oh I thought your mom was doing that"" or ""ask you father, I am busy now"" are commonly heard in two-parent households. Sometimes in a two-parent household there is no connection or communication. What we find is that children often fall through the cracks at home. I think one of the most difficult conversations I have with parents when I inquire about home life in general is when one parent confides in me, ""I am only staying for the children."" It seems like I have heard that all my life. Immediately, what I imagine is lots of arguing, fighting, avoidance of communication. It all adds up to poor modeling. Parents feel that they are sacrificing for their children when sometimes all they are doing is adding to the problems. And believe me, those problems are just around the corner. It doesn't provide a stable environment and these parents spend less individual time with their children because they are too busy worrying about avoiding the other parent. I think the worst thing I see is using the children to gain power. Before you know it, the parents are in an argument and by default the child ends up losing. This, of course, is an extreme but I wouldn't be able to write about it unless I have seen it or heard it. And believe me I have. I am not saying that being a single parent is better or easier. It is just different and like all things it is whatever you make of it. I am saying that children that come from single parents don't necessary come from the disadvantaged home. The role of single parent can be much harder than that of a two-parent household. It depends on the parent, of course. Something I realize is that Julianna is fortunate to spend quality time with both of her parents. Not all children can say that they spend time equally with both parents. The time I get to share with her is that much more precious to me. Maybe that is why I advocate so much to spend quality time with your children. Since all I know is single parenthood, I feel that it is a blessing for me because I cherish our time together and try not to take it for granted or waste it. Two-parent households take for granted that they have children and rarely divide time equally between their children. For example, Julianna and I have established soma routines that are very predictable. We spend Tuesdays and Thursdays evenings together. The activities we do vary but in the end they include one favorite TV program, a bath, books and a meal. Every Tuesday we cook dinner together and eat at home. Thursdays we go out to eat. On Mondays and Wednesdays she knows her father will come to our house and spend his individual time with her. They read, play games, go to the library and eat together. Since she was three, she knew her days of the weeks based on her schedule, which in the end has provided her with a stable, secure environment. On the weekends that she spends time with her father, I make it a priority to do laundry, clean house and spend time with friends and plan what we will do when she is home the following weekend with me. By doing this I ensure that when she is home I have taken care of the basics and can dedicate my time to her. When she is home we spend quality time with each other, friends and family. I plan short trips, educational excursions and time in our garden. I realize that not all single parents have established routines because they work multiple jobs and are juggling multiple roles. However, just like all things in life anything is possible.",2003,10-Apr
Group gathers to plant parkway trees,Jaide,Anaheim Bulletin,english,"Children were chasing each other in the parking lot giggling, while the parents were visiting, chatting. One truck was loaded with ice, containers, sodas, barbecue supplies and watermelons. A few of the children were overheard saying that they can't wait for the watermelons. The families had begun to arrive at the church parking lot as early as 8 a.m. on April 26. By the time the scheduled gathering organized in the auditorium of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints on Loara Avenue at 9, more than 200 volunteers were ready to begin the eighth annual Volunteer Connection Day / Arbor Day Tree Planting. Coordinated in partnership with Community ReLeaf Anaheim, the city Urban Forestry office and funded by Boeing Anaheim and the California Department of Forestry, this yearly event to plant parkway trees in neighborhoods had become a family tradition. Dennis Irving, the event coordinator, welcomed the families and thanked them. Church members, he said, looked forward to participating in this community event every year. I explained to the audience the educational part of tree planting. ""We plant trees for others, it is the most unselfish gift we can give a community,"" I said. ""A Chinese proverb asks: 'Who thought of me 20 years ago, that I might enjoy the shade of this tree today.'"" Since 1990, Community ReLeaf Anaheim has planted an estimated 9,000 trees. Led by Sally White, our founder who died a few years ago, we were instrumental in promoting trees as a way to make our city more asset valuable. In 2002 alone, more than 1,000 trees were planted, many by children as part of their community service obligations. Volunteers have descended on Anaheim neighborhoods on Saturday mornings, shovels in hand, dug into city parkways and planted 15-gallon trees, as requested, ""green side up, brown side down"" rushing out by noon. Trees are truly the lungs of the cities; they breathe new life. A breath of fresh air, if you will. A community group, a church, a large corporation, the city and the state, coming together, represented by 256 people strong, on a Saturday morning to plant trees for the benefit of a neighborhood with more than 1,000 homes is a testament to the strength of a coalition. The coalition of tree planting friends made a choice to make a difference by planting greenery that will make our piece of the world a shade better. And it is in caring to do so that the strength of the coalition lies. Volunteering means you choose, you don't have to, you don't get paid and you may not get anything back other than that feeling. But by choosing to do good for others, we help not only them, but ourselves, for we have chosen to connect with the world at large. Volunteering helps connect us to the unseen threads that unite us all. Choosing to volunteer is a very good choice indeed. Life isn't much unless you give a little every now and then. Volunteering is untapped resource and it is so free to do and so freeing.",2003,10-Apr

Schools are continuing modernization projects,OLIVIA MACIEL,Anaheim Bulletin,english,"A new era begins this year in Anaheim, with school districts continuing classroom and campus improvements this year through funds provided from bond measures passed in March 2002 and with new people assuming leadership roles.

""But we have to plan ahead."" Anaheim City's eligibility for future matching state funds could be in jeopardy because of a lack of new students. The state gives funds priority to districts with growing enrollments.

""It's a real dilemma. It's like you've built yourself into a box,"" Silverman said. Proposition 55, a new bond measure that is scheduled to be on the March ballot, will determine whether the district will sell its bonds to start on new projects or if it will continue with its current projects and wait on others.

Take care when disposing household items, Roger Smith ,Anaheim Bulletin,english,"Many of you may be thinking about clearing and cleaning out your garage and home of old paints or other household products. It is important to take care when disposing of certain household items. Many products found in your home may be a potential hazard. Some substances, because of their chemical makeup, can poison, corrode, explode or ignite easily when handled improperly. If discarded, they are considered a household hazardous waste and are not exempt from California hazardous waste laws. When disposed of improperly, they may threaten our health and our environment. Therefore, it is illegal to dispose of household hazardous waste in the trash, down storm drains, toilets or on the ground. The very first step in handling chemicals properly is to read the manufacturer's label. As an example, the following materials are considered a hazard if they fit into one or more of the following categories: Poisonous or lethal when ingested, touched or inhaled (even in small quantities). Flammable: Ignites easily. Corrosive: Eats away materials and living tissue by a chemical reaction. Reactive: Creates an explasion or produces deadly vapors (example: bleach mixed with an ammonia-based cleanser). Adhesives, latex and oil-based paints, household polishes and cleaners, drain openers, lighter fluids and paint thinners are a few common items considered hazardous when discarded. Improper handling or disposal of products containing hazardous ingredients can result in serious injuries or contamination to our community. These hazardous waste products can injure firefighters when responding to a fire or injure landfill workers due to poisonous fumes caused by mixed or concentrated chemicals and also seriously damage the environment by contaminating groundwater used for drinking water. Safety Tips for Household Hazardous Waste Read manufacturers' label. Store chemicals properly. Handle chemicals with care. Dispose of chemicals properly. Household hazardous wastes need to be professionally handled during disposal. For more information on locations for disposing of household hazardous waste or used motor oil call 1-800-CLEANUP or the Anaheim Fire Department Used Oil Program at 765-4048.",2004,01-Jan

Through this role-playing event, participants develop a greater understanding of world problems and the complexity of international relations. Previous Anaheim Ambassadors have represented such countries as China, Jamaica, Mauritius and Spain and held positions including Security Council president, vice president of General Assembly and members of the press.

Arlene Noriega wins title of Cinco de Mayo queen.,Olivia Maciel,Anaheim Bulletin,english,"Mariachis played their trumpets, horns and accordion in the background as the crowd gathered to watch the four young women vying for the Cinco de Mayo crown parade to the stage. The participants, dressed in white, flowing gowns, with diamond studded tiaras decorating their heads, walked the stage nervously and awaited the announcement of who would be crowned Cinco de Mayo Queen 2003-04. Emcee Manuel Gomez cracked jokes and finally read the last envelope and announced Arlene Noriega as the winner. She then received a large bouquet of roses and a trophy. She was draped in a red velvet robe as she began her year-long reign. Noriega will also receive a $1,000 scholarship and a trip for two to Cruz Azul, Mexico.

Take care when disposing household items, Roger Smith ,Anaheim Bulletin,english,"Many of you may be thinking about clearing and cleaning out your garage and home of old paints or other household products. It is important to take care when disposing of certain household items. Many products found in your home may be a potential hazard. Some substances, because of their chemical makeup, can poison, corrode, explode or ignite easily when handled improperly. If discarded, they are considered a household hazardous waste and are not exempt from California hazardous waste laws. When disposed of improperly, they may threaten our health and our environment. Therefore, it is illegal to dispose of household hazardous waste in the trash, down storm drains, toilets or on the ground. The very first step in handling chemicals properly is to read the manufacturer's label. As an example, the following materials are considered a hazard if they fit into one or more of the following categories: Poisonous or lethal when ingested, touched or inhaled (even in small quantities). Flammable: Ignites easily. Corrosive: Eats away materials and living tissue by a chemical reaction. Reactive: Creates an explasion or produces deadly vapors (example: bleach mixed with an ammonia-based cleanser). Adhesives, latex and oil-based paints, household polishes and cleaners, drain openers, lighter fluids and paint thinners are a few common items considered hazardous when discarded. Improper handling or disposal of products containing hazardous ingredients can result in serious injuries or contamination to our community. These hazardous waste products can injure firefighters when responding to a fire or injure landfill workers due to poisonous fumes caused by mixed or concentrated chemicals and also seriously damage the environment by contaminating groundwater used for drinking water. Safety Tips for Household Hazardous Waste Read manufacturers' label. Store chemicals properly. Handle chemicals with care. Dispose of chemicals properly. Household hazardous wastes need to be professionally handled during disposal. For more information on locations for disposing of household hazardous waste or used motor oil call 1-800-CLEANUP or the Anaheim Fire Department Used Oil Program at 765-4048.",2004,01-Jan
Euclid is most complained about street in city,Lisa O'Neil,Anaheim Bulletin,english,"Euclid Street has drawn the most complaints from Anaheim residents who have called a hotline to complain about too many red lights on the county's streets. The Orange County Transportation Authority has received about 25 calls about Anaheim streets and intersections on a hotline set up to gather complaints about the poor coordination of traffic signals, said OCTA spokesman John Standiford. The most calls in Anaheim have been about Euclid Street, north of Lincoln Avenue, he said. Those callers complain that they always have to stop at every light, Standiford said. OCTA also has received calls about the intersection of Katella Avenue and State College Boulevard and about Orangethorpe Avenue, east of Rose Street. John Lower, the city's traffic and transportation manager, said there are a number of closely spaced signals on Euclid from the Riverside (91) Freeway to Lincoln Avenue. ""That area is going to improve with the widening of the 1-5,"" he said. ""A lot of people I know are frustrated with (the area),"" Lower said. Lower said that the traffic on Katella and State College changes by the hour, time and day of the week. Events at Anaheim Stadium often create traffic jams at the intersection. But a 1991 traffic study showed that the intersection offered an ""acceptable level of service,"" Lower said. Lower said that residents should avoid the area when there are events at Anaheim Stadium. Signals on Orangethorpe Avenue will be coordinated with the help of Measure M, the county's half-cent transportation sales tax, he said. The city of Fullerton will work to improve the coordination of traffic signals on Orangethorpe. OCTA has received more than 300 calls since beginning the hotline before Thanskgiving. OCTA plans on collecting the data and passing it on the city traffic officials. Residents who want to comment about signal coordination can call OCTA's Customer Relations Department at 636-RIDE, or l-(800) 636-RIDE from outlying areas of the country.",2004,01-Jan
Council delays debate on term limits,Eleeza V. Agopian,Anaheim Bulletin,english,"The City Council on Tuesday delayed for one week the debate on setting term limits for board and commission members, as community members turned out to criticize the proposal. Mayor Curt Pringle said that Councilman Richard Chavez, who was absent because of an illness, asked that discussion be continued so that he could be present. The council previously voted 3-2 to ask City Attorney Jack White to draft an ordinance on the issue. Pringle and Chavez were joined by Councilman Tom Tait, who asked that such an ordinance be explored. Council members Shirley McCracken and Bob Hernandez voted against the proposal, saying that the council would do just as well if it removed those board and commission members it felt were no longer sewing the city well. Former councilwoman Miriam Kaywood asked the council to go back and take a second look at the proposal. ""This is such an insult to the people who have been serving and serving well,"" she said. ""If they're not doing their job all you have to do is say I move to remove this person ... and I know because I've done it. If someone is not serving the city well, then you should remove them."" move members they don't feel are best serving the city. ""We don't need new ideas. We've got ideas coming out the gazoo,"" he said. ""What we need is intelligent people who must know the subject that they're addressing."" Chamber of Commerce President Mike Neben also addressed the issue, saying that as a representative of the city's business community the chamber wants experienced commission members to be able to continue their service. ""We favor talcing the political motives out of the selection and appointment process, holding the appointees accountable ... and removing those that are incapable of performing in a professional and unbiased manner,"" he said. The proposed ordinance would require any current board or commission members who are serving past two full four-year terms would be required to vacate their seats within 90 days. The city's guidelines for board and commission term limits would follow those set for council members - limiting members to two consecutive terms and forcing a two-year period off any boards before they can be reappointed. The limit would also prohibit members from more than one commission at a time, with the exception of ex-officio members who have to represent boards or commissions to other commissions. The ordinance would also count as one full service any two partial terms that equaled at least half a full term. In a separate ordinance, the council is also considering restructuring the Golf Course Advisory Commission, whose members have averaged more than 20 years each. The ordinance, if approved, would reduce the number of members from nine to five - though four only serve now. A parenthetical to the golf ordinance indicated that the city is moving toward dissolving the Anaheim Arts Council, replacing it with a Cultural Commission. The Arts Council, which was created by an ordinance in 1977, was always meant to be temporary. With the city's approval of a new cultural plan also came the suggestion to detach the Arts Council from the city and help it become its own nonprofit organization. The parameters of a Cultural Commission, which would be tasked with the goals laid out in the cultural plans, have not yet been hammered out, according to Community Services director Chris Jarvi. Council OKs permit parking on Clearbrook Residents of Clearbrook Lane secured guaranteed parking for their neighborhood Tuesday night when the City Council voted 4-0 to allow permit-only parking on the residential street from Webster Avenue to the end of the culdesac. Councilman Richard Chavez was absent from the meeting. All the residents of the street signed and delivered a petition to the city in November, seeking to form a resident-only parking area. The Planning Department supported their request and the Police Department agreed to patrol the street for violations. Here are other results from the Anaheim City Council meeting Tuesday night: STATE COLLEGE BOULEVARD Approved a $185,753 contract with R.J. Noble Co. for the State College Boulevard project, to conduct road way improvements between Orangethorpe Avenue and Via Burton Street. Approximately $100,000 in federal funds are set aside for the project. Approved, 4-0. Mayor Curt Pringle, Yes; Bob Hernandez, Yes; Richard Chavez, Absent; Shirley McCracken, Yes; Tom Tait, Yes. STATE COLLEGE AGREEMENT Approved the agency-state agreement to conduct improvements along State College Boulevard. The city applied for the funds to complete the project through the Orange County Transportation Authority, which obtained the funds through a state-administered program. BUS SHELTERS Approved extending an agreement with Viacom Outdoor, Inc. to continue maintenance services for bus shelters in the city on a month-to-month basis for eight months. The agreement also authorizes the staff to continue month-to-month agreements after the foregoing eight months. In 1994, the city entered into an eight-year agreement with Viacom. At the end of that contract, in October, the city solicited bids for a new service provider, but found none, sticking with Viacom. The agreement will generate about $13,000 each month for the city. VETERANS FUNDS Accept an award of $96,000 from the county's Board of Supervisors for the Workforce Investment Act Cost Reimbursements Agreement with the county for the Veteran's Employment Program Services. The state recently approved a request from the Anaheim and county workforce investment boards to develop a program, managed by the city's Workforce Development Division, serving 30 veterans through the Anaheim Workforce Center. THERAPEUTIC RECREATION CENTER Approved a one-year lease agreement with the YMCA of Orange County, authorizing it to use the Anaheim Therapeutic Recreation Center for a Saturday night class for developmentally disabled adults..

Special education students compete in district tournament,Olivia Maciel,Anaheim Bulletin,english,"Anaheim Union High School District special education students Friday competed in the district's first adaptive physical education tournament. More than 300 students and 100 staff members converged on Savanna High School for a day of basketball games, complimentary lunch from Panda Express and autographs from the Laker Girls. Pam Herrera, a Savanna adaptive P.E. teacher, coordinated the event. ""The purpose of the event is to allow students to socialize with their peers and to have a good time,"" and promote health and exercise, Herrera said. Although the initial event was to be a small basketball tournament as part of the regular adaptive P.E. curriculum, it became something larger. Ricky Jojola, a specialed assistant, and John Donnelly, coordinator of Best Buddies, an organization that helps people with mental disabilities, helped expand the event, Herrera said. Donnelly said his only goal is to put a smile on the students' faces. Donna Anderson, also a Savanna adaptive P.E teacher, agreed. ""We're here to celebrate what we have in common, not our differences. Competition in the games is a low-level aspect (of the event). It's the socializing that will help them with life skills,"" Anderson said. ""At first they were very isolated on our campus, but now they actually come over and talk to more people,"" said Alicia Spencer, a Savanna senior and Best Buddies member. Principal Rick Martens said the event had a good outcome. ""My whole intent is to get everybody together as a group. There are no divisions here,"" Martens said. The students' disabilities ranged from severe mental to physical impairments. On duty for potential injuries was Esther Soe, a district nurse. High School, Williams began as a Cub Scout at age 5 and is now a member of Troop 120. ""I just wanted to finish my scouting career,"" he said, of working toward becoming an Eagle Scout. ""I wanted to go all the way."" He said it felt good to be able to help the school keep the playground open. Smith, a senior at Loara High School and a member of Troop 110, said completing the project was fulfilling for him, too.   ""It's a great feeling,"" he said, adding that becoming an Eagle Scout has long been a goal for him, as well. John Parsons, Scoutmaster for Troop 120, who was on hand the last work day to help the boys put the finishing touches on their projects; says it's satisfying for him, as well, to see his scouts grow and mature. ""I'm very proud,"" he said. ""These are my boys. I made a commitment that if they (put in the effort,) I'd be here.""

Lending a helping hand,Eleeza V. Agopian,Anaheim Bulletin,english,"Being a Boy Scout means being a good citizen and helping others in your community. To become an Eagle Scout, you have to take those qualities a step further and embark on a service project that demands leadership, responsibility and organization. For two aspiring Anaheim Eagle Scouts, that project meant keeping Anaheim Presbyterian Children's Center from shutting down its playground. A new state law set higher standards for private schools operating playgrounds. The stricter regulations, which came with a hefty pricetag, had to be met by Jan. 1. Had the school, part of First Presbyterian Church at 310 W. Broadway, paid for the new awning and shed necessary to meet the standards, it would have cost upwards of several thousand dollars. ""This is so fantastic,"" said Kellie Lowe, center director. ""This organization, under Judy's leadership, has been a total blessing to us because we could not financially afford it."" Georgia ""Judy"" Arnold, an Eagle Scout adviser, heard about the school's needs through Chris Smith, 18, who was looking for just such a project. She took to setting it up for the boys: Kyle Williams, 14, and Smith. A third Scout, Allec Blanco, will soon begin renovating the school's bathroom as his project. Arnold, who became involved in the Boy Scouts organization eight years ago when her son joined Troop 120, said it's satisfying to see the boys mature and take on such responsibilities. ""When he (my son) become an Eagle, I told him that once you finish it, those boys will start moving,"" she said. ""And that's exactly what happened and that was four years ago."" Williams and Smith got to work in the fall, raising money, seeking donations, organizing volunteers and setting up work days. Williams raised almost $600 and Smith garnered about $400 from car washes and garage sales. Freleaux is just one of the many who volunteered to help Boy Scout Kyle Williams with his Eagle Scout projections from Ganahi Lumber and building an awning for the play Home Depot, as well as securing food donations from Campbell's Donut Shop and Papa John's for the work days: ground and Smith was tasked with building the new shed. Council repeals 30-day limits on motel stays The City Council on Tuesday unanimously approved repealing 30-day stay limits on three motels in the city and adopted a resolution prohibiting future councils and other city bodies from passing similar restrictions. Executive Suites at 1850 W. Lincoln Ave., the Best Budget Motel at 420 S. Beach Blvd. and the Covered Wagon at 823 S. Beach Blvd. all operate under conditional use permits that require guests to move out after 30 days and bars them from spending more than 30 consecutive days at a motel in a 90-day period. ""We've done everything we can to accommodate these people but it's been a tragedy these last couple of years because we've had to kick so many people out after 30 days,"" said Greg Parkin, owner of the Covered Wagon. While the council voted unanimously, Councilwoman Shirley McCracken suggested that without stay limits the city needs another method for enforcing codes at motels. ""I think we need to find some other tools that insist that these places are safe places and clean places,"" she said. Mayor Curt Pringle said the limits only hurt poor families who lived in motels. ""I don't believe that this city is doing anything by this action to reduce the requirements to have safe properties available through motels,"" he said. ""I also don't believe there is any greater degree of safety provided by throwing people out after 30 days."" The council's vote also directs the Planning Commission to go back and review the conditions imposed on those motels and change the zoning resolution",2005,27-Feb

Magnolia High students building fitness center,Olivia Maciel,Anaheim Bulletin,english,"Magnolia High School students are converting an old auto shop into a fitness center to improve their morale and lift their spirits after losing three of their peers in an accident a few weeks ago. The fitness center has been an ongoing project for two years, but plans to convert the facility had remained stagnant. The project has brought people closer together. ""It's (the death of students) sad, but things are now changing and getting better,"" said Stacy White, a junior at the school. In order to raise money for the fitness center, several students were involved in fund-raising projects, such as selling candy and a holding a golf tournament. ""It wouldn't have come about if it weren't for the students' initiative,"" said Bob Frasco, boys' athletic director. Although the district worked on modernizing the school with Measure Z funds, converting the shop into a fitness center was more of a ""want than a need,"" Frasco said. So the district did not fully finance the facility. Nevertheless, the district provided new carpet, paint and mirrors. Students wanted to see the change happen so they decided to clear up the old shop, which was being used as a storage room. ""Students came in for 3 to 4 straight weekends to clear out the place, ""said Rick Penn, a math teacher. Jeremy Rosa was one of those students. ""There were several of us who came in on weekends,"" Rosa said. ""I think the whole football team came."" ""But I also don't think it would have happened if the coaches didn't push the administration."" The shop saw its share of body work until it was shut down two years ago. Body work can take on a new definition, once the project is complete. The new fitness center weights and cardiovascular machines. ""With fitness going down the drain, students and faculty could really benefit from this,"" Frasco said. ",2005,27-Feb
Beloved school crossing guard dies at 76,Diane Reed,Anaheim Bulletin,english,"Gladys Bennink risked her life every day for the safety of children. For nearly a decade, she shepherded Imperial Elementary School students across the busy intersection of Imperial Highway and Nohl Ranch Road. Twice, she was injured on the job, including once in a hit-and-run accident. On March 11, the crossing guard who served the school from 1976 to 1983 died in Bakersfield. She was 76. Born on Oct. 7, 1926, in the city of Northeast, Penn., Gladys was a friendly farm girl. She lost her left arm as a young child when a fracture turned into gangrene. But she never let the loss slow her down or keep her from doing farm chores with her nine siblings. ""She often said she never really missed it because she had grown up, for the most part, without the arm,"" said her son Lowell, a sports reporter for the Register. ""She didn't remembered much about having two arms."" ""Gladys the crossing guard,"" as Imperial Elementary School children knew her, was born Gladys Stoddard. She married Edward Bennink at 18 when she was still in high school. Her husband was headed off to the Pacific islands to fight in World War II. They married while he was on leave.

Gladys and her husband had four children, three boys, Lynn, Blair and Lowell and a girl, Melanie. ""Mom had an endearing quality. You knew just by looking at her that she didn't have an easy life,"" daughter Melanie Cantu said. ""She just had this way of connecting with people.

She worked in retail at Montgomery Ward, she cleaned model homes, she sold Tri-Chem liquid embroidery. In the fall of 1976, she began helping children to and from Imperial Elementary in Anaheim Hills. She was the school's first and only crossing guard for many years. Everyone loved her.

They showed their appreciation by showering her with little gifts. ""She would come home with the backseat of her car full of presents,"" Lowell recalled. ""Even people who didn't have kids would stop and give her flowers or small gifts,"" he said. ""She loved it."" Anaheim Hills motorcycle officers knew her, too. They often stopped to check on her or just to chat. Once, she broke her foot during the day but finished her shift - making sure the children were safe - before calling her employer to say she was hurt. When bumped by a car in her crosswalk, she gave police a full description of the vehicle, including a key an identifying mark on the hood. It was the spot where she had whacked it with her big, red, stop sign. It helped them find the culprit. Imperial Elementary held ""Gladys Appreciation Days"" in her honor several times before she transferred James Guinn Elementary in 1983. They held a ""Good Bye Gladys"" day for her, too. She worked at Guinn from 1983 through 1986 when she became supervisor of the Anaheim's crossing guards. ""She loved that job, too. It made her feel important,"" Bennink said. ""My mom always referred to that job as 'supervisor over the crossing guards in Anaheim.' She never said it another way. And she always said it with an air of deep importance."" She saw it as the most important job in the world. She suffered a stroke in the mid-1990s that forced her to retire. She lost her husband in 2000 and then moved to Bakersfield to live with her daughter. She was bedridden for the last 18 months of her life. ""Gladys the crossing guard"" loved her plants and her pets. She enjoyed reading and watching TV, particularly soap operas and the news. She rooted for the Lakers and Angels. ""She even rooted for the replays,"" Cantu recalled. She was hospitalized on Super Bowl Sunday with congestive heart failure and clung to life for two months. She died as she had lived, surrounded by children - but in the end they were her own. She is survived by sons Lynn, Blair and Lowell Bennink, daughter Melanie Cantu, son-in-law Alex Cantu and daughter-in-law Lisa Bennink. She also lives on in the memories of hundreds of other children who she thought of as hers.",2005,27-Feb
AUHSD cutting budget,Olivia Maciel,Anaheim Bulletin,english,"Anaheim Union High School District trustees gave tentative approval to budget cuts totaling $5.9 million in response to the state's $6 billion cut in education spending. Thirty-five full-time employees and one part-time employee were given preliminary notices that they may be laid-off by June 30. Those employees that were given notices ranged from program administrators, psychologists, teachers on special assignments, librarians and a nurse. No permanent teachers were given notices. ""The first premise was not to take teachers out of the classroom,"" said Barry Escoe, district director of human resources. ""The choices are to deal with management, non-management, administrative positions and teachers on a temporary contract,"" Escoe said. ""It's also based on seniority."" Some district employees asked the board to reconsider their choices, particularly the possible lay-off of a registered nurse. Pat Gladysz, a Hope High School health services technician, asked the board to keep Jane Kelly because she ""is an asset to Hope."" ""I know that the budget has a restriction and times are tough,"" Gladysz said at the meeting. ""Our students at Hope High School have restrictions. For them life is tough."" Many Hope High School students have multiple disabilities. The school will still keep the rest of the nurses employed by district, but Gladysz argues that Kelly is as important as the rest. ""Jane Kelly is not only a highly skilled nurse that has exceptional affection and compassion for our students but a nurse that has stayed at Hope and has committed herself to meeting the needs of our students,"" Other changes in the district include reducing the number of substitute teachers, extra-conference periods for teachers, restructuring clinical social outreach programs, restructuring alternative education, and cutting summer school administrative positions.",2005,27-Feb
Fire Safety,ROGER SMITH,Anaheim Bulletin,english,"The January 2003 Emergency Survival Program, produced by the Governor's Office of Emergency Services, began by focusing on how some recent floods, fires and earthquakes in Southern California have affected families and neighborhoods, businesses and schools. In California, local government is the first to respond to emergencies. Additional personnel and equipment from neighboring cities and counties may be available to assist if needed. After a damaging flood, fire, earthquake or other emergency, individuals, neighborhoods, businesses and schools might be on their own for at least 72 hours. In recent weeks residents have asked what to do to be better prepared for a crisis here at home. Preparing for an incident of homeland security is the same as preparing for earthquakes, fires, floods and other disasters. The following steps are designed to increase your safety and survival. Remember - preparedness is the key. The first step is to find out what can happen. Determine what the possible threats are and discuss them with your family, household, or co-workers. Create an emergency plan. Be sure to include your out-of-town contact to check on each other if telephones are overwhelmed or out of service. Assemble a disaster supplies FIRE CHIEF ROGER SMITH kit, in easy to carry containers, at home, at work and your car. Include a three-day supply of water, non-perishable food, first aid kit and flashlights, battery-operated radio, extra batteries, fire extinguisher, tools, prescription medications, copies of important documents, duct tape, plastic sheeting and towels to seal door cracks. Learn basic first aid and CPR. The American Red Cross provides training. Be aware of your surroundings and report any suspicious activities to local authorities. Know where the emergency exits and fire extinguishers are at home, at work, or when traveling and practice emergency evacuation procedures. Check on the school and day-care emergency plans for your school age children. Learn what to do if asked by officials to ""shelter in place"" (remain indoors or in your car), or to ""evacuate""(leave a hazard area).",2005,27-Feb

Painting delayed but goes forward,Eleeza V. Agopian,Anaheim Bulletin,english,"The rain may have put a dent in their plans, but Paint Your Heart Out, Anaheim, volunteers stuck to their duties, putting in hours after work on weekdays and setting out early Saturday morning. Twenty houses were finished during the weekend and the all-volunteer teams will finish work on this year's 50 houses by Saturday. Members of the Kiwanis Club of Greater Anaheim showed up at Grayzna Czescik's home at 7:30 Saturday morning and finished by 1 p.m. - with the help of Czescik, her daughter and grandson. ""We are absolutely amazed,"" said Joanna Nachurski, Czescik's daughter. ""Because we have been in California for 10 years ... and this program, those people are very supportive to the community and very enthusiastic about the project."" Nachurski and her children live with Czescik. The Kiwanis Club was joined by students from Anaheim high school Key Clubs, who spend nearly every Saturday working on different service project. They said Paint Your Heart Out stands out from their other volunteer efforts because they see the results of their work. ""It's physically different,"" said Grace Kwon, 16, president of Kennedy High School's student body. ""You can see the difference."" The student body presidents from Katella and Savanna high schools also helped with the painting. ""We're out here to help our fellow community,"" said Eddie Ortiz, 17, Savanna High School's student body president. Czescik said she was pleased to see so many youth - nine from Katella, Kennedy, Savanna and Anaheim high schools pitched in. ""It teaches them the concept of work,"" she said. John Poole, team captain for the Kiwanis Club, is one of the founders of Paint Your Heart Out, Anaheim. ""For the young people it really instills an ethic to go back to the neighborhood,"" he said. Poole, who recently retired from his post as the city's code .enforcement manager, said programs like Paint Your Heart Out Anaheim are part of what make Anaheim a vibrant community. ""One of the great lessons that was learned, once we got past the frustration of the postponement (is) the level of ""Those people , are very supportive to the community and very enthusiastic about the project."" JOANNA NACHURSKI the commitment to the homeowners,"" said Carolyn Griebe, executive director of Paint Your Heart Out Anaheim. Community members from one church pitched in to help a neighbor from another church.

The volunteers, all 55 of them, regrouped after the original paint day was rained out to give 90-year-old Parslow's home a fresh coat of paint. Some volunteers came from Parslow's own church who painted the body of the house. ""The trim was completed by the Anaheim United Methodist Church team. The last 10 houses will be completed this Saturday, with a few more receiving finishing touches this week. Paint Your Heart Out officials set a May 17 deadline for all the volunteer teams. The irony of rain on the 13th year of Paint Your Heart Out was not lost on Griebe, who said the board has learned its lesson from this year's experience.

Children's Arts Festival Saturday,Eleeza V. Agopian,Anaheim Bulletin,english,"By the end of Saturday, the world's next Pablo Picasso or Frida Kahlo may have discovered his or her natural talent - whether through stringing together a noodle necklace or folding an origami bird. Or it may be that the 11th annual Anaheim Children's Arts Festival will inspire that youngster to pursue the performing arts after watching dance performances or listening to others try their voices at the karaoke station. Whatever it is that speaks to them, the organizing committee of the annual festival hopes it stays with the children. ""They get an exposure to art that maybe they don't usually get because it's hard to be able to go to one spot for experiences with music, drama sculpting, drawing, everything,"" said Andrea Manes, event coordinator for the festival. This year's festival features 63 booths of arts and crafts projects as varied as chalk art and pinwheel making to coffee filter flowers and origami. All the activities are free and there is no admission to the festival. The Anaheim Bulletin, an event sponsor, will have its annual Draw Your Hero booth as part of the festivities. Children are give a passport to visit different booths throughout the day. After completing six activities on the passport, the children can redeem a free gift a the Anaheim Museum, a can of play-dough. The festival also includes live entertainment on two stages throughout the morning and afternoon. Some of the acts include Ballet Folklorico Amor de-Mexico, Anaheim Ballet, Afro-Caribbean Dance Review, California All Star Cloggers and Oxford Academy's jazz band and string and wind ensembles. Unlike previous years, this year's festival will not include a pancake breakfast due to waning interest last year, Manes said. The extra early-morning hour will be added to the afternoon, for an additional hour of activities. Last year's festival attracted 7,000 people and organizers say they expect more this year. An invitation to the festival has been extended to the Garden Grove Unified School District, as well as the eight school districts with schools in Anaheim. Food and children's carnival games and rides will also be available for a nominal fee. But Manes says she's always pleased that the children don't ask where the video games are. ""It just goes to show the arts are really important to children,"" she said. This year's festival runs from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m. along Center Street Promenade downtown next to City Hall West, 201 S.

Some line up as early as 4 a.m. for chance to buy playoff tickets.,Eleeza V.

Just before 10 a.m., ticket sellers called out a random wristband number, and a very surprised Jerry Marsilio popped out from under a barricade to be first in line. The Westminster resident bought 16 tickets - eight each for home games Wednesday and Friday against the Minnesota Wild. He laid out $1,152 - $72 a pop - for seats in Section 430. ""They're not bad seats,"" said Marsilio, 39, who arrived at 7:30 a.m. ""I'm just happy I'm going."" Wearing a big grin, Bill Chapin, director of ticket sales for the Mighty Ducks, savored the crowd bustling around him. . The team gave out 450 wristbands and organized a second line for the additional fans. ""I am the busiest man in Orange County right now,"" he said. Chapin said he's been getting calls from practically everyone he's ever known. ""I've had a lot of colleagues calling, a lot of family calling, a lot of friends and a lot of people I haven't talked to for a long time,"" he said. Today, Arrowhead Pond and Ducks staff, along with city officials, will enjoy a BBQ lunch courtesy of Brad Mayne, manager of Dallas' American Airlines Center. Mayne lost a bet on the Dallas Stars-Ducks series to Pond general manager Tim Ryan. Mayne, the Pond's general manager when it first opened in 1993, will don a Ducks jersey and serve up BBQ beef at the Pond. Another bet is on the line as Mayor Curt Pringle placed a friendly wager with St. Paul Mayor Randy Kelly for the Ducks-Minnesota Wild series.

Major League fun at the library,Olivia Maciel,Anaheim Bulletin,english,"Giggles, squeals, oohs and ahhs are sounds you don't hear in a library too often. But last Thursday the noises were expected as more than 75 sixth-graders from Benito Juarez Elementary School and their teachers met Angels' catcher Bengie Molina and Sharon Robinson, daughter of late Hall of Famer Jackie Robinson at the Sunkist Branch Library. The program was part of Join the Major Leagues at your library. But the event didn't call for students to trade in their thinking caps for baseball hats, just yet. Robinson, vice president of educational programming for Major League Baseball, started the program last year after being approached by the American Library Association to encourage literacy. As part of the program, Robinson travels to different major cities in which the playoffs or World Series have been played and visits local libraries along with a Major League player from that city. Robinson included Anaheim in this year's 20-year tour because of the-Angels World Series victory in October. Librarian Carol Stone opened the program. ""We're here to celebrate two American classics - baseball and libraries,"" Stone said. After the welcome, Stone allowed Robinson to take over the event. Robinson then introduced Molina, saying catchers don't spend their entire lives on their knees. She asked Molina about his catching skills and Molina tied his reading skills to his sport. ""It's not just about catching,"" Molina said. ""I have to read and study reports on other players to learn their skills. Then I work on my strategy."" The children also participated in a baseball trivia game that gives them a chance to be entered in a nationwide drawing to win a trip for two to the World Series, including round-trip coach air fare and double occupancy hotel accommodations for two nighty . Sharon Robinson visits with Juarez Elementary School sixth-graders at the Sunkist Library to give them tips on literacy. Those who answered correctly received Angels' paraphernalia such as shirts, plush balls, bender toys and videos. The baseball trivia component is part of a nationwide online game, meant to encourage people to visit their local libraries and do research on the Internet for the correct answers. Juarez students, however, were given the opportunity to verbally answer the questions and fill-in the answers as they went long. That gave them the opportunity to turn in their correct answers to be eligible for the grand prize. Twelve-year-old Ana Gonzales, who was dressed in a red Angels' shirt and baseball hat with a Rally Monkey hanging on her neck, said she was happy to meet Molina, even though her favorite player is Troy Glaus. Eleven-year-old Courtney Montenegro didn't win a prize but was happy to be there. ""I'm happy that I got to see Jackie's daughter,"" Montenegro said. Among the people in attendance were Anaheim City School District Superintendent Sandra Barry and council members Bob Hernandez and Richard Chavez. ""Whatever we can do to inspire our children to read is great,"" Chavez said. Children raise their hands to answer a question, above, during a visit from Sharon Robinson and Angels catcher Bengie Molina, left, at the Sunkist Library.",2006,15-May
Modernization continues at Magnolia district schools,Olivia Maciel,Anaheim Bulletin,english,"Magnolia School District schools are undergoing construction, after receiving a total of $24 million dollars in combined funds from the state, the county, and a bond measure last year. Modernization projects are in the later phases at Lord Ba den-Powell, Walt Disney, Peter Marshall, Robert Pyles, Jonas Salk, Albert Schweitzer and Esther Walter schools. Juliette Low and Mattie Lou Maxwell schools will begin construction within the next year. ""We chose the schools with the most needs first,""said Rick Turrentine, deputy superintendent of resources and services. ""Our goal is to eventually renovate all nine schools in the district."" The district is upgrading alarm systems, reworking the underground electrical and plumbing fixtures, replacing old heating systems and installing air conditioning, among other projects. The schools have been around since the 1950s. Turrentine, who has been in the district for 24 years and has spent half of those years in his current position, said the schools have never been modernized. ""We have maintained our schools on a regular basis,"" Turrentine said, through painting and other maintenance projects. ""In fact our schools look good, but there are infrastructure things that need to be done and many seem to hit at 30 to 40 years of a building's life."" Turrentine said the useful life of a building is about 40 years. After that, schools must either be torn down or rebuilt. The schools that have gone through modernization projects have experienced some inconvenience. Most teachers and students have shifted into portable classrooms. ""I'm sure it's inconvenient,"" Turrentine said. ""But unfortunately, that's how it is on construction sites. However, we try to see how we can minimize the problem."" Marshall and Pyles are scheduled to be complete in June, Schweitzer and Salk in August. Walter is scheduled to be complete in January 2004 and Disney and Baden-Powell in February. The N.E.W.

DUCKS,STARR BUCK,Anaheim Bulletin,english,"However, should Minnesota take the series, Pringle will provide lunch for Kelly and his guests courtesy of CKE Restaurants and Hardees, an eight-foot Palm Tree from Visser's Florists, a bottle of California wine from The Catch restaurant, a crystal statue of Sleeping Beauty's castle and a box of Anaheim chili peppers from Gigante grocery store. Both mayors have also agreed to don the winning team's jersey for the day and issue a proclamation congratulating the winning city, should their team lose. Many fans simultaneously stood in line and dialed Ticketmaster on their cell phones to try to secure the coveted tickets. Karen Pedersen, 59, and son-in-law Roger Hicks, 33, arrived at 6:45 a.m. armed with lawn chairs and books. ""I actually think in Orange County we're very polite fans,"" said Pedersen, of Huntington Beach.

Jeff White, 32, of Tustin took half a day off work and arrived with a lawn chair and a laptop. White proposed to his wife, Lora, at a Ducks game two years ago. He waited until the end of the game to make sure he popped the question on a winning night, though he says he's not superstitious. Still, White said, he follows one ritual for Ducks games: He always wears the same white turtleneck, a pair of jeans and his tan socks. ""The one game when I learned my lesson was when I wore the black socks,"" he said. ",2006,15-May
Hills neighbors at odds over garage,Diane Reed,Anaheim Bulletin,english,"Ray Currie just wanted a garage big enough for all of his cars. The 2,900-square-foot steel and aluminum structure he is building at the end of a Martinez Road has become something more - a conversation piece. ""I've got a lot of hobbies,"" Currie said. ""Antique cars Stock cars. I've got eight or nine I guess. I've never stopped to count them."" He is building a prefabricated garage that is 65 feet long, 45 feet wide and 22 feet 4 inches tall, to hold them. When he built his 6,000-square-foot home in the 7000 block of Martella Lane in 1987, he included a three-car garage. ""I thought that would be enough,"" he said. It wasn't. In the last couple of years, Currie's car collection has grown. Cars on trailers, trucks, and recreational vehicles, some bearing the Currie Enterprises logo, have been parked along an unpaved easement known as Martinez Road. ""I graded the biggest possible pad and I'm building the biggest possible garage. Economically it didn't make sense to build anything smaller."" His neighbors aren't so sure. ""If I put that thing up on my lot they would dynamite me,"" said Paul Martin, owner of the property next door and an easement that ends at the Currie's garage. He noticed the concrete foundation two months before the steel framing went up. He says he went to the city to find out what would be built there. ""At first I was told that there were no plans (for a structure),"" he said. Later he said that he was alternately told that the plans had been ""lost, misfiled, misplaced or would not be available for viewing until after construction was completed."" ""It looks like a welding shop,"" he added. ""I'm worried they are going to do commercial work in there."" Currie Enterprises, the firm owned and operated by the Currie family, makes high performance parts for muscle cars, racecars and off-road vehicles. Currie said he might work on his own cars in the oversized garage, but insisted that all commercial work would be done at Currie Enterprises. ""That thing is just a monster,"" said Sharon Painter, who passes it on her way home. ""It is what everybody sees as they come up Mohler Drive and it looks pretty awful."" Painter, a yoga instructor, wonders how such a building was permitted in the scenic corridor. ""My ex-husband and I planted an orange grove and the city made us send out postcards to all the neighbors. They were real sticklers at the time,"" she said. Currie says he has talked to his neighbors and there are no problems. His father and brothers own most of the homes on Martella. ""We have no problem with the garage,"" said Charlotte Lark whose home is across the street from the structure. ""None at all. Its great."" Other neighbors were not notified of the Currie's garage it did not require a zoning variance or conditional use permit. ""It is within the code,"" said Fred Martinez, city building operations manager. ""The city cannot discriminate between manufactured buildings and on-site construction,"" said Greg Hastings, the city's zoning manager. Sonja Grewal, secretary for the Anaheim Hills Citizens Coalition suggested a possible avenue for those who oppose such structures in the city's scenic corridor. ""One option would be to participate in the city's general plan review process,"" she said. ""The zoning code is also under review."" Hastings said that existing setback and height requirements are being met and no commercial work would not be permitted there. He added that as an accessory building the garage must be in proportion to the main house. ""We wouldn't allow a building of this size behind a tract house in West Anaheim,"" Hastngs said. ""But because of the size of the Curie home, it is proportional."" He said there aren't many such structures in the city. He recalled only one. ""I think that one is being used as a stable,"" he said.",2006,15-May

Hills neighbors at odds over garage,Diane Reed,Anaheim Bulletin,english,"Ray Currie just wanted a garage big enough for all of his cars. The 2,900-square-foot steel and aluminum structure he is building at the end of a Martinez Road has become something more - a conversation piece. ""I've got a lot of hobbies,"" Currie said. ""Antique cars Stock cars. I've got eight or nine I guess. I've never stopped to count them."" He is building a prefabricated garage that is 65 feet long, 45 feet wide and 22 feet 4 inches tall, to hold them. When he built his 6,000-square-foot home in the 7000 block of Martella Lane in 1987, he included a three-car garage. ""I thought that would be enough,"" he said. It wasn't. In the last couple of years, Currie's car collection has grown. Cars on trailers, trucks, and recreational vehicles, some bearing the Currie Enterprises logo, have been parked along an unpaved easement known as Martinez Road. ""I graded the biggest possible pad and I'm building the biggest possible garage. Economically it didn't make sense to build anything smaller."" His neighbors aren't so sure. ""If I put that thing up on my lot they would dynamite me,"" said Paul Martin, owner of the property next door and an easement that ends at the Currie's garage. He noticed the concrete foundation two months before the steel framing went up. He says he went to the city to find out what would be built there. ""At first I was told that there were no plans (for a structure),"" he said. Later he said that he was alternately told that the plans had been ""lost, misfiled, misplaced or would not be available for viewing until after construction was completed."" ""It looks like a welding shop,"" he added. ""I'm worried they are going to do commercial work in there."" Currie Enterprises, the firm owned and operated by the Currie family, makes high performance parts for muscle cars, racecars and off-road vehicles. Currie said he might work on his own cars in the oversized garage, but insisted that all commercial work would be done at Currie Enterprises. ""That thing is just a monster,"" said Sharon Painter, who passes it on her way home. ""It is what everybody sees as they come up Mohler Drive and it looks pretty awful."" Painter, a yoga instructor, wonders how such a building was permitted in the scenic corridor. ""My ex-husband and I planted an orange grove and the city made us send out postcards to all the neighbors. They were real sticklers at the time,"" she said. Currie says he has talked to his neighbors and there are no problems. His father and brothers own most of the homes on Martella. ""We have no problem with the garage,"" said Charlotte Lark whose home is across the street from the structure. ""None at all. Its great."" Other neighbors were not notified of the Currie's garage it did not require a zoning variance or conditional use permit. ""It is within the code,"" said Fred Martinez, city building operations manager. ""The city cannot discriminate between manufactured buildings and on-site construction,"" said Greg Hastings, the city's zoning manager. Sonja Grewal, secretary for the Anaheim Hills Citizens Coalition suggested a possible avenue for those who oppose such structures in the city's scenic corridor. ""One option would be to participate in the city's general plan review process,"" she said. ""The zoning code is also under review."" Hastings said that existing setback and height requirements are being met and no commercial work would not be permitted there. He added that as an accessory building the garage must be in proportion to the main house. ""We wouldn't allow a building of this size behind a tract house in West Anaheim,"" Hastngs said. ""But because of the size of the Curie home, it is proportional."" He said there aren't many such structures in the city. He recalled only one. ""I think that one is being used as a stable,"" he said.",2006,15-May
Painting delayed but goes forward,Eleeza V. Agopian,Anaheim Bulletin,english,"The rain may have put a dent in their plans, but Paint Your Heart Out, Anaheim, volunteers stuck to their duties, putting in hours after work on weekdays and setting out early Saturday morning. Twenty houses were finished during the weekend and the all-volunteer teams will finish work on this year's 50 houses by Saturday. Members of the Kiwanis Club of Greater Anaheim showed up at Grayzna Czescik's home at 7:30 Saturday morning and finished by 1 p.m. - with the help of Czescik, her daughter and grandson. ""We are absolutely amazed,"" said Joanna Nachurski, Czescik's daughter. ""Because we have been in California for 10 years ... and this program, those people are very supportive to the community and very enthusiastic about the project."" Nachurski and her children live with Czescik. The Kiwanis Club was joined by students from Anaheim high school Key Clubs, who spend nearly every Saturday working on different service project. They said Paint Your Heart Out stands out from their other volunteer efforts because they see the results of their work. ""It's physically different,"" said Grace Kwon, 16, president of Kennedy High School's student body. ""You can see the difference."" The student body presidents from Katella and Savanna high schools also helped with the painting. ""We're out here to help our fellow community,"" said Eddie Ortiz, 17, Savanna High School's student body president. Czescik said she was pleased to see so many youth - nine from Katella, Kennedy, Savanna and Anaheim high schools pitched in. ""It teaches them the concept of work,"" she said. John Poole, team captain for the Kiwanis Club, is one of the founders of Paint Your Heart Out, Anaheim. ""For the young people it really instills an ethic to go back to the neighborhood,"" he said. Poole, who recently retired from his post as the city's code .enforcement manager, said programs like Paint Your Heart Out Anaheim are part of what make Anaheim a vibrant community. ""One of the great lessons that was learned, once we got past the frustration of the postponement (is) the level of ""Those people , are very supportive to the community and very enthusiastic about the project."" JOANNA NACHURSKI the commitment to the homeowners,"" said Carolyn Griebe, executive director of Paint Your Heart Out Anaheim. Community members from one church pitched in to help a neighbor from another church. Dorothy Parslow, 90, a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, got a helping hand Saturday from volunteers with Anaheim United Methodist Church. The volunteers, all 55 of them, regrouped after the original paint day was rained out to give 90-year-old Parslow's home a fresh coat of paint. Some volunteers came from Parslow's own church who painted the body of the house. ""The trim was completed by the Anaheim United Methodist Church team. The last 10 houses will be completed this Saturday, with a few more receiving finishing touches this week. Paint Your Heart Out officials set a May 17 deadline for all the volunteer teams. The irony of rain on the 13th year of Paint Your Heart Out was not lost on Griebe, who said the board has learned its lesson from this year's experience. In the future, if it looks like rain the Friday before paint day, painting will automatically be postponed to the following Saturday.",2006,15-May
Residents split on current council,VIK JOLLY,Anaheim Bulletin,english,"When the City Council in June repealed a law limiting motel residents to a 30-day consecutive stay in a 90-day period, Jim Parkin said he had never been happier for his customers and his business. ""I can't tell you how wonderful it has been to own a business in Anaheim with the new council,"" said the owner1 of the Covered Wagon motel. That's the tone many business owners and residents are taking in Anaheim, where a new council took office one year ago and has steered the city toward less government interference. Others say, however, they are concerned about the new direction the city is taking. Under the old 30-90 law, Debbie Ainge, her son and her boyfriend would have had to leave the Covered Wagon and would have been unable to return for 60 days. With the 30-90 law re pealed, the family instead has to move out after 28 days and can move back in the next day. ""It's our home,"" she said. In the year since Mayor Curt Pringle and new councilmen Richard Chavez and Bob Hernandez have taken their seats on the dais with council members Tom Tait and Shirley McCracken, the City Council has decriminalized penalties for code enforcement violations, emphasized seat belt education over enforcement and created term limits for city boards and commissions to offer more residents a chance to participate. But not everyone thinks the changes are for the better. Judithanne Gollette, vice chairwoman of the West Anaheim Neighborhood Development Council, said she believes the council is listening, but only to special interests. ",2007,04-Dec

"Veterinary hospital 
gets council OK",Eleeza V. Agopian,Anaheim Bulletin,english,"A veterinary hospital may soon begin construction in a residential neighborhood after the City Council voted to approve it Tuesday despite neighbors' complaints and threatened legal action. The council voted 3-2 after a 2 hour public hearing. Mayor Curt Pringle and councilmen Richard Chavez and Tom Tait, voted for the project to move forward. Council members Shirley McCracken and Bob Hernandez were in opposition. The hearing was marked by eight residents who spoke out against the project and more than 25 people in the audience. Opponents said increased traffic, noise and other environmental impacts make the veterinary hospital incompatible with the surrounding neighborhood. Nearly 65 residents hired a lawyer and appealed the Planning Commission's decision in September to allow construction at 5055 E. Short St. to move forward. Now, those residents say they plan to file a lawsuit against the city. ""This is just not a good place to put in something that will probably create more traffic than that whole street creates now, by itself,"" said Wendy Miller, who lives on Brandon Circle adjacent to the hospital site. Pringle, Chavez and Tait all said that heavy traffic along Kellogg Drive leading to Short Street from Esperanza High School could create a dangerous situation. Pringle asked staff to report back to the council on the issue. ""The traffic issue is far and away exacerbated, not by the uses on this site or in that neighborhood but by the high school's size and the number of kids who bring cars to school,"" Pringle said. ""These are issues that need to be addressed (but) we shouldn't put that entire burden on the feet of this property owner."" The 10,000-square-foot facility would be open 7 a.m. to 9 p.m. weekdays and 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. weekends. In addition to veterinary care, it will also provide grooming and boarding services.

Fresh perspective helping move the city forward,CURT PRINGLE,Anaheim Bulletin,english,"Welcome to the inaugural edition of what will be a monthly mayor's column. This month marks the first anniversary of my election as mayor of Anaheim, as well as that of council members Richard Chavez and Bob Hernandez. Joining with returning members Tom Tait and Shirley McCracken, this new City Council has brought a fresh perspective to our city government and an opportunity to move our city forward. In the year since, we've worked together to make great strides on projects both big and small for our city. Perhaps most importantly, this council has fostered a new climate that says Anaheim is open for business or, as one commentator characterized our new council dynamic, ""freedom-friendly."" This operational reform says to our business community: ""If you consider Anaheim as the place to conduct your business, we want to give you the tools necessary to help you be a vibrant, profitable part of our community."" This characterizes how we have approached the amendment to Anaheim's General Plan, the document that will guide Anaheim's land use for the 21st century. We are about to begin some MAYOR CURT PRINGLE major development in outdowntown, which will bring in new shops and residences. We are reinvigorating the Stadium Area, which will create a hub of residential, commercial, office and entertainment venues. We worked all year to bring a new managing partner to the Arrowhead Pond in order to protect and enhance one of our city's crown jewels. In April, PGA champion Tiger Woods arrived at Dad Miller Golf Course to break ground and kick off a fund-raising campaign for the Tiger Woods Learning Center. We have also made progress on several projects that don't always grab the headlines but are just as important to making Anaheim a great city. We have moved forward with our neighbors, the city of Yorba Linda and BNSF railroad in our plans to build a new soundwall adjacent to the tracks. In February, the Mayor's Sports Field Task Force was formed, charged with identifying where the city could provide more recreational opportunities for our youth. The Task Force worked throughout the summer and submitted a list of recommendations. ",2007,04-Dec
Dedicated to the Virgin,OLIVIA MACIEL,Anaheim Bulletin,english,"Claudia Rivas, enjoys the festivities around Christmas time. But she is especially fond of the feast day of Our Lady of Guadalupe. Rivas, a devout Roman Catholic, joined Las Guadalupanas, a group dedicated to honoring and serving the Virgin Mary, as a way to show her gratitude to the virgin. She is among more than 40 Guadalupanas who helps set up the festivities for Dec. 12 at St. Anthony Claret Roman Catholic Church. ""We're in charge of hiring mariachis, buying roses and other flowers for the altar, providing sweet bread and hot chocolate,"" Rivas said. When the 85-year-old woman joined the group seven years ago, she was going through a bitter divorce. She prayed to the Virgin Mary to help her get through it and to allow her now 9 year-old son to always be provided for. Since then, she has been volunteering, whether physically or financially, to the group. Dec. 12, the day that Roman Catholics believe the Virgin Mary appeared to Juan Diego, a humble Indian, is generally celebrated throughout Mexico and other Latin American countries. People gather in city plazas or at basilicas by the hundred of thousands. In Jose Hernandez's hometown of Leon, Guanajato, Mexico, several people gather in the morning and carry in altar of the Virgin Mary across town. ""People walk about 14 hours, with breaks of course, to the next town, carrying the altar, while mariachis sing,"" said Hernandez, who has played Juan Diego in the re-enactment of the apparition at St. Anthony Claret. Although the feast isn't celebrated in the United States the way it's celebrated in Mexico, it still draws large crowds. Last year more than 3,500 people attended morning Mass at St. Anthony Claret, listening to the mariachis play ""Las Mananitas,"" a morning serenade to the Virgin Mary. ""It takes a lot of time to prepare for those celebrations,"" Rivas said. ""We have to start early in the year to prepare for this day."" Las Guadalupanas raises money for the event by selling tamales and coffee outside of i church or by holding other fund-raisers. ; The event costs a few thou- j sand dollars, Rivas said, who j didn't know the exact amount j spent. I ""In the end, it doesn't really j matter how much is spent,"" I Rivas said. ""It's worth being j able to continue a tradition j and expanding the faith of the Virgin."" Margarita Martinez braves the morning chill to participate in a celebration of the Feast of Our Lady of Guadalupe held in 2001 in the former Jeffrey-Lynne neighborhood. Celebrations this year are scheduled at local churches on Dec. 12, although some churches are celebrating Mass nightly in the days leading up to the feast day. What are you praying for? We asked people what they are praying for this year. Claudia Rivas: ""I'm praying for world peace... for the young children, for the single mothers in the world. I'll pray that they always be blessed."" Maria Rosas: ""That day, I will thank the Virgin for everything she has given me. My mom said that when I was born, I had a crooked leg and that she asked the Virgin to help me heal. It was a miracle."" Jazmin Vargas: ""I'll pray for peace within families and the whole world."" Emilia Barillas: ""For peace, for peace within drug addicts and alcoholics and for violence to diminish."" Jose Hernandez : ""I'll pray for peace. I also want to ask the Virgin to help me see my family in Mexico again because I'm on my own here.""",2007,04-Dec

Anaheim stables provide shelter,Eleeza V. Agopian,Anaheim Bulletin,english,"They came down the mountain to escape fires, smoke and poor health conditions. Now they're camped outdoors, in round pens and stables. Some of the refugees from last week's wildfires have found a temporary home at Rancho del Rio Stables. The horses - 10 in all have gotten accustomed to city life, away from their ranches and sprawling properties in Southern California's rural spots. Jayne Jones, owner of the stables, said there's no room left in the 166 stables, though she expects most of the horses to begin returning to their owners' stables. ""At least we can do something to help,"" she said. ""We hate to say no. We're trying to be creative."" Desperate fire refugees continued calling through last week, Jones said, and she suggested they try boarding their horses at the Orange County Fairgrounds and El Rodeo in Brea. The last three Jones said she was able to take had to stay in a round pen, rather than individual stables. ""We're just trying to be creative instead of making everybody put their horses in a pasture,"" Jones said. Terry Orbis, Rancho del Rio's manager, made the trek to the thick of the Paradise fire to help evacuate three horses, three dogs and a cat. ""Just give me the animals,"" she said. ""And I'll take care of that. I don't do hospitals, I don't do people, just give me the animals."" From where she stood, Orbis said the flames were visible in the trees next to the house and the smoke thick. For others, it wasn't the danger of fire that spurred them to relocate their animals.

So Gallagher brought Cotton and Katie down from Chino Hills to Rancho del Rio. ""We got them out of there soon enough,"" he said. ""So they weren't too exposed.

Sports complex at Magnolia High considered,Eleeza V. Agopian,Anaheim Bulletin,english,"Repeated concerns from West Anaheim residents and discussions at City Council meetings have led to a proposed solution for sports enthusiasts in the city's west end. A proposal to build a sports complex at Magnolia High School is making its way through the city's early planning stages now in an effort to alleviate crowded fields throughout the city, but mostly in West Anaheim, according to city staff. Mayor Curt Pringle in June asked city staff to begin working on a proposal for a sports complex at Magnolia High School. It. was at this meeting when West Anaheim residents first criticized the plan for the reconfiguration of Maxwell Park, saying the design created too many active uses of the space. Jack Kudron, interim community services director, said an early estimate of the project sets the price tag at somewhere between $1 million and $1.5 million. He said the city has contracted a landscape architect to draft a preliminary site plan. The project wouldn't go out to bid until after the 2004-05 fiscal year budget is approved. That budget would include the funds for the sports complex. ""The way the fields that are laid out at Magnolia High School, (they) could be laid out more efficiently,"" Kudron said. By reconfiguring the space two new fields could be added at Magnolia, Kudron said. Another major component of the project would be to light those fields, which would be designed as multi-purpose so that they could be used for baseball , Softball , soccer or football. According to city figures, West Anaheim currently has 43 soccer fields. Of those, 29 are dedicated to youth soccer and the remaining for adults. A plurality, 35, are unlighted. Central Anaheim has 34 soccer fields and East Anaheim has 18, according to the same city count. After West Anaheim residents criticized the city's proposed plan for redesigning Maxwell Park to accommodate an expanded library and additional parking, the city turned around last week and agreed to a compromise on the design. The agreement pleased some residents, who said it was a step in the right direction, who stopped short of saying it was a good plan. ""We're pleased that Mayor Pringle has not taken a hard-nosed stance on the old plan and that he is looking at possibilities,"" said Judithanne Collette, land use chairwoman for the West Anaheim Neighborhood Development Council. ""But it could be a much better comprehensive plan. It's another piece of quilt work."" Paul Mercier, superintendent of Magnolia School District, whose office abuts Maxwell Park, said the district's board is also pleased with the compromise plan.

Students post gains in standardized tests,OLIVIA MACIEL,Anaheim Bulletin,english,"Anaheim students, like their peers statewide, showed significant improvements in the Academic Performance Index scores this year, primarily because they were tested on what they have learned in the classroom and not on the Standard 9 test, which compares them to other students nationally.

Families should have own emergency plan,ROGER SMITH,Anaheim Bulletin,english,"Emergency preparedness is everyone's business and not just government agencies. All sectors within our community such as service providers, businesses, civic and volunteer groups, neighborhoods, as well as individual residents, should all plan ahead for any kind of emergency. During the first few hours or even days following a disaster, essential services may not be available. People must be ready to act on their own. Here are simple steps people can take to be prepared: Step 1: Have a Family Plan - Families should get together to discuss their plan and talk about the steps they'll take to be ready. Learn to shut off utilities such as gas, electricity and water. Remember to plan for family members with special needs. Step 2: Take Action - Each family member, regardless of age, can be responsibly for helping the family be prepared. Activities can include posting emergency telephone numbers, installing smoke detectors, determining escape routes, assembling disaster supply kits or taking first aid and CPR courses. Step 3: Practice and Maintain FROM THE CHIEF FIRE CHIEF ROGER SMITH the Plan - Everyone should know the plan and practice the plan on a regular basis so each family member will know what to do in an emergency. It is often the quick, decisive response that can make the difference. Take the time to practice your evacuation procedures. Step 4: Organize Your Neighborhood     The final step emphasizes the need for neighborhoods to take action by forming a community response team. If a community response team has not been organized form one",2007,04-Dec
Painting delayed but goes forward,Eleeza V. Agopian,Anaheim Bulletin,english,"The rain may have put a dent in their plans, but Paint Your Heart Out, Anaheim, volunteers stuck to their duties, putting in hours after work on weekdays and setting out early Saturday morning. Twenty houses were finished during the weekend and the all-volunteer teams will finish work on this year's 50 houses by Saturday. Members of the Kiwanis Club of Greater Anaheim showed up at Grayzna Czescik's home at 7:30 Saturday morning and finished by 1 p.m. - with the help of Czescik, her daughter and grandson. ""We are absolutely amazed,"" said Joanna Nachurski, Czescik's daughter. ""Because we have been in California for 10 years ... and this program, those people are very supportive to the community and very enthusiastic about the project."" Nachurski and her children live with Czescik. The Kiwanis Club was joined by students from Anaheim high school Key Clubs, who spend nearly every Saturday working on different service project. They said Paint Your Heart Out stands out from their other volunteer efforts because they see the results of their work. ""It's physically different,"" said Grace Kwon, 16, president of Kennedy High School's student body. ""You can see the difference."" The student body presidents from Katella and Savanna high schools also helped with the painting. ""We're out here to help our fellow community,"" said Eddie Ortiz, 17, Savanna High School's student body president. Czescik said she was pleased to see so many youth - nine from Katella, Kennedy, Savanna and Anaheim high schools pitched in. ""It teaches them the concept of work,"" she said. John Poole, team captain for the Kiwanis Club, is one of the founders of Paint Your Heart Out, Anaheim. ""For the young people it really instills an ethic to go back to the neighborhood,"" he said. Poole, who recently retired from his post as the city's code .enforcement manager, said programs like Paint Your Heart Out Anaheim are part of what make Anaheim a vibrant community. ""One of the great lessons that was learned, once we got past the frustration of the postponement (is) the level of ""Those people , are very supportive to the community and very enthusiastic about the project."" JOANNA NACHURSKI the commitment to the homeowners,"" said Carolyn Griebe, executive director of Paint Your Heart Out Anaheim. Community members from one church pitched in to help a neighbor from another church. Dorothy Parslow, 90, a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, got a helping hand Saturday from volunteers with Anaheim United Methodist Church. The volunteers, all 55 of them, regrouped after the original paint day was rained out to give 90-year-old Parslow's home a fresh coat of paint. Some volunteers came from Parslow's own church who painted the body of the house. ""The trim was completed by the Anaheim United Methodist Church team. The last 10 houses will be completed this Saturday, with a few more receiving finishing touches this week. Paint Your Heart Out officials set a May 17 deadline for all the volunteer teams. The irony of rain on the 13th year of Paint Your Heart Out was not lost on Griebe, who said the board has learned its lesson from this year's experience. In the future, if it looks like rain the Friday before paint day, painting will automatically be postponed to the following Saturday.",2007,04-Dec
Meeting Max and Maxine,Olivia Maciel,Anaheim Bulletin,english,"There was something "" Udderly "" special at Sunkist Elementary school last Thursday. Students got the opportunity to see a cow during a Dairy Council of California assembly, a program that takes lessons and livestock on the road statewide to t each children about a cow's anatomy, its digestive system, and the role of dairy products in the human diet. The Mobile Dairy Classroom, a classroom on wheels, visited the campus with 2- year-old ""Maxine"" and her 3-month-old bull calf, ""Max."" ""This is a great opportunity for students to learn where milk comes from,"" said Lyoelle Hamilton, PTA vice president, who helped with the event. Third-grader Ariana Castellanos said she woke up early, eager to see a cow. ""I told my mom we were going to have a cow at school, but I don't think she believed me."" The lessons covered California State Curriculum Standards for language, math, science and health education. Steve Miller, the mobile classroom instructor, gave students lessons that were both insightful and fun. When giving them key terms to remember such as ""pasteurize,"" he asked students to participate. ""OK, move your hands over your eyes,"" he said. ""You see, your hand has just 'passed your eyes.'"" Miller also pointed to the top of Maxine's head and asked students what the cow was missing. While students yelled out ""brains"" and ""hair,"" one student cleverly said, ""A hat like yours?"" ""No, it's definitely not a hat. How about horns?"" Miller asked. Sunkist Elementary school students take a closer look at ""Maxine,"" a-Guernsey cow from Bay Meadow Farms.

Celebrate season with holiday home tour,Eleeza V. Agopian,Anaheim Bulletin,english,"This year's Colony progressive potluck also doubled as a preview for the debut of the home tour. This is a sneak preview of the tour set for this weekend. It started off as a what-if idea. What if the neighbors who organize the monthly Colony district potluck took their annual holiday progressive potluck and made a holiday home tour? Could they pull it off? They could and did. And this weekend marks the first Heritage Square Holiday Home Tour. ""We've got people coming from other historic districts to check this out,"" said Cynthia Ward, one of the organizers, by way of explaining how well they've pulled it off. The monthly Colony potluck began about five years ago when neighbors decided they wanted to reclaim Pearson Park, then overrun with drugs and crime. But soon the weather grew cold and they moved the party inside to a different home each month. Around the holidays, it turned into a progressive potluck, moving from home to home. ""If we're going to the time and trouble of cleaning up our houses and inviting people over, let's do a home tour,"" Ward said. ""Any chance we get to have a party is great,"" said Bonnie Kridner, who hosted the appetizers and entree portion of the progressive potluck at her home, the Grimshaw House at 105 S. Rose St. It's not just the traditional holiday lights and carefully decorated Christmas trees adorning the historic homes - though those are included in the festive adornments. A highlight of the homes is 18 hand-painted angels presiding over every corner of the five homes on the tour. Colony residents Luther Tatum and Gerry Baker-Tatum designed the angels, which are posted around the yards of the tour homes. Luther Tatum said he and his wife - both artists with a studio next to their Colony home - drew inspiration for the faces from 15th and 16th century artwork. The couple spent two weeks in their studio coming up with the design. Neighbors and high school students pitched in and helped with the painting. The tour will also include Boulevard, as were many of the homes in Heritage Square. The 1906 Victorian home has served several purposes including a practice space for Lawrence Welk and was once occupied by Bobby Hatfield of the Righteous Brothers in the 1950s live entertainment from local student choirs and dance groups. Four of the angels held court above the Chinn's back yard, the Cahen-Clendenen home at the corner of Cypress Street and Vintage Lane. Built in 1882, the Cahen-Clendenen home is thought to have the first indoor toilet in Anaheim, though the fact cannot be confirmed. The Hatfield house, on Rose Street, was moved from its original location on Anaheim Tickets are still available for the Friday and Saturday tours. Homes are open from 6 to 10 p.m. on both days and the walking tours will go on even if it rains. Tickets are $20 for adults, $15 for seniors, students and museum members. Family packs are available for $50 and includes admission for two adults and up to four supervised children. Additional children's tickets are $5 each. Parking is available at the city garage on Center Street and the tour begins at the Anaheim Museum, where shuttles will be available to the tour neighborhood.",2008,11-Dec
ALL LIT UP FOR THE HOLIDAYS,Eleeza V. Agopian,Anaheim Bulletin,english,"Anaheim ushered in the holiday season this weekend with two tree lightings. West Anaheim kicked off the celebrations Friday night with its fifth annual event. The West Anaheim Neighborhood Development Council hosted the festivities at Twila Reid Park on Orange Avenue, between Beach Boulevard and Lincoln Avenue. About 500 people were on hand to watch children light the tree, which will stand through New Year's Eve. Even Santa Claus was on hand to give out 300 bags filled with goodies. Students from Maxwell and Pyle elementary schools sang for the audience. Downtown also flipped the switch with its own celebration Saturday. The Downtown Anaheim Association, the city and the Anaheim Ballet put together the program. Nearly 600 people attended the day's events, according to DAA director Joe Honescko. It included songs from the combined choirs of Anaheim's high schools, performances from ""The Nutcracker"" by the Anaheim Ballet and a holiday village and craft fair.

Anaheim Magazine splits in two,Diane Reed,Anaheim Bulletin,english,"""Anaheim Magazine"" has a sleek, new look. The Winter 2004 edition features a glossy, four-color format and four of the city's top chefs on the cover. The magazine no longer contains the city's recreation schedules, however. They are now part of a separate publication called the ""Anaheim Community Services Guide to Activities and Programs."" It has a photo of a woman doing yoga on the cover. The redesigned, quarterly magazines were mailed in November. ""Both publications are mailed to all of the residents of Anaheim,"" City spokesman John Nicoletti said. ""Anaheim Magazine is also mailed to all of the city's businesses. Copies are also available at city facilities such as the libraries and community centers."" Inside the revamped Anaheim Magazine you'll find features and photos on everything from the police department and the Angels to local restaurants and public utilities. ""One of the reasons we have separated the publications is to begin accepting advertising in Anaheim Magazine,"" Nicoletti said. ""It is a new opportunity for us."" The current issue features a profile on the city's new planning director Sheri Vander Dussen and a comprehensive (if slightly out of date) listing of the city's commissions and commissioners. For example, Terrina Picarello, Anaheim Hills' ""Citizen of the Year"" is listed as a current member of the park and recreation commission, even though she relocated to the East Coast months ago. There are also sports stories, Mighty Ducks schedules and a calendar of upcoming events at the Arrowhead Pond, the Anaheim Convention Center, The Grove of Anaheim and the House of Blues. There's only one thing missing. Anaheim Hills is scarcely mentioned. There is a brief on the date for opening ceremonies at the Anaheim Hills Golf Course Clubhouse. But Acting Community Services Director Jack Kudron says that the date listed is questionable. ""There are some things on back-order and we may not be able to hold the opening until February,"" he said. You can also find a couple of Anaheim Hills restaurants mentioned but that's about it. All four chefs featured on the cover and in the center spread are from West Side restaurants - The Anaheim White House, Mr. Stox, Napa Rose and The Catch. ""I think they need to pay a little closer attention to the East End of town,"" Realtor Karyn Schonherz said. ""We have featured Anaheim Hills businesses in the past,"" Nicoletti who is also the magazine's managing editor said. ""We had the president of Boeing on the cover when we did a story on Boeing last year."" ""For me, it's harder to keep track of two magazines people are going to togs it (Anaheim Magazine). When it had the recreation schedule inside we had a reason to hang onto it."" ""I do think it is really lovely. I just don't know what they plan to do with it,"" she added. Hills resident Pam Fraser wondered about the Community Services Guide. ""Why are we advertising yoga classes in Fullerton?"" Fraser asked. ""We have two (yoga) studios right here in Anaheim Hills."" The 2003-04 City budget shows the average cost of Anaheim Magazine to be 32 cents each     the same cost as last year when there was just one publication. It does not show the cost of preparing two separate publications each requiring separate bindery, and mai""Because we began this new format in the middle of our budget year,"" Nicoletti said, Community services pays for a portion of the publication and the public information office pays for a portion."" He added that that would change next year. The City budget shows a circulation for Anaheim Magazine of 122,000. At 32 cents each that amounts to $39,040 for one 56-page magazine. That is the same cost as the previous year. No mention is made of the additional cost to circulate two separate publications of 24 and 40 pages each. The City budget does not specify if postage is included in the unit price. The U.S. Postal Service confirmed, however, that the city mailed two publications in November, each of them to 100,000 people. Anaheim Magazine was sent at the rate of 13.4 cents each, according to the USPS spokesman. That is $13,400 per 100,000 edition. With four editions a year, that is $53,600 annually. The Community Services guide was mailed at the slightly lower rate of 12.8 cents - $12,800 per 100,000 or $51,200 per year. That is a total of $104,800 for postage annually. ""Both publications are done with the assistance of outside consultants,"" Nicoletti said. ""But city departments oversee the editorial control and design."" Bret Colson and Associates and John Price Design are responsible for Anaheim Magazine and the recreation guide is produced with the help of Anaheim Community Publishing. According to Nicoletti the force behind splitting Anaheim Magazine in two was the broad range of the information it previously contained. ""The information contained in the recreation guide and the magazine has become increasingly diverse,"" he said. ""The feeling was that the public was not getting the benefit of the stories and the recreation guide when it was combined."" ""We will continue to focus on citywide issues and look to represent all areas of the city,"" he said.",2008,11-Dec
"Planners approve 
Caliber 
project",Diane Reed,Anaheim Bulletin,english,"The Planning Commission approved a new Caliber Mo tors showroom in Anaheim Hills on Monday, but asked the owners for major architectural revisions. Commissioners asked Caliber's architect to revise plans for a two-story, showroom and to turn the reflective glass box into something more aesthetically compatible with the surrounding community. They moved the project ahead on the condition that the building is completely redesigned. ""Maybe there is something we can do architecturally because I'd hate to see this thing go by the wayside,"" Commissioner Jerry Connell said. Planning commissioners asked the architect to make it look more like the Kaiser Medical building at SaviRanch, which is a combination of green glass and stone. The City Council will review the proposals in January. If approved, Caliber could be doing business along the River side (91) Freeway by next sum mer. It will be an $8 million to $10 million project, said Don Bering, Caliber's chief financial officer. The two-story building will be 32 feet tall.' Rooftop utilities, which were to have added an additional 10 feet to the structure, would be housed in side it. Commissioners approved the project even though only Caliber staff members spoke in favor of it and 661 signatures opposing it were received by the Planning Department. Melissa Monk-Turney, who bought a home in the Canyon Oaks development immediately adjacent to the proposed dealership, recently said she was unaware of the project at the time. ""Did I know that there was going to be a car lot there?"" she asked commissioners. ""No. I as a homeowner did not have to sign a disclosure. I moved (to the Canyon Oaks development) to get away from the train noise (elsewhere in Anaheim Hills)."" Now Monk-Turney is troubled by the thought of 200 trucks passing along her property line daily while the dealership is being built. ""Construction emissions would exceed the Southern California Air Quality Management District's threshold for nitrogen oxides and particulate matter during construction days,"" she said. She is also concerned about the loss of habitat for 11 bird species with special status and the loss of breeding grounds for the Cooper's Hawk, white-tailed kite, California horned lark, loggerhead strike and the burrowing owl. Cheryl Thompson, a representative of D.R. Horton, developers of Canyon Oaks, said homebuyers were notified as soon as the developer became aware of the project. ""This is not what we want to see in Anaheim Hills,"" said Stefanie O'Neill, president of the Concerned Citizens of the Canyon. ""But this land will not remain undeveloped. The owners have a right to make income off of their land. ""Since houses cannot be built and the city refuses to make it a park, it will be utilized for some sort of commercial use.

Mark Messia, a 20-year resident of Anaheim Hills, said the land was supposed to have been a green belt. ""I don't know of one resident who is interested in having a car lot there,"" he said. ""I used to be a car salesman with Yeakle Brothers when I was a teen-ager. I don't care what you call it, a car lot is a car lot and it should be in an industrial area."" Caliber Motors' executives have long desired freeway exposure and they reminded commissioners that Caliber sells about $200 million worth of cars annually and generates about $1 million in sales tax revenue for the city. ""The city would like it for the money,"" Messia said. ""But I am diametrically opposed to this as are most of the residents."" Bering said Caliber needs that land because it is losing one of its showrooms at 5401 E. La Palma Ave. ""Our landlord did not to re new our lease,"" Bering said. ""The Land Rover dealership will be expanding there."" The Anaheim Hills Citizens Coalition also opposes the plan.

5 Points decision on hold,Eleeza V. Agopian,Anaheim Bulletin,english,"Bid to create second historic district delayed after zoning change appealed. With the City Council prepared to pave the way for the city's second historic district, an appeal to their decision has put that action on hold. City staff, acting on a request from the now-defunct Colony Neighborhood Council, proposed changing the zoning in the 5 Points Neighborhood from commercial and multiple-family zones to a single-family zone. The neighborhood is bound by the Santa Ana (1-5) Freeway to the west, Broadway to the south, West Street to the east and Cherry Street to the north. John Zahn, who owns a single-family home in the proposed district, said reclassifying the area amounts to spot zoning. He filed an appeal to the Planning Commission's decision. A public hearing is scheduled for Jan. 27. ""It'll devalue the property,"" he said. ""Who would want to buy a piece of property for single-family residents when it's surrounded by apartments?"" But city staff say downzoning and possibly creating a historic district would add value to the properties in the neighborhood. Zahn, (JO, bought the home at 1127 W. Broadway four years ago as an investment for when he retires from selling tires. Zahn now rents out the three-bedroom home, but said he planned to convert it into a six- or seven-unit apartment building. A zoning change would prevent property owners from constructing new apartment or commercial buildings and would grandfather in existing shops and apartments in the neighborhood. Zahn said he wants the council to grandfather in his property so he can go forward with his plans to build apartments.

Waleska Hernandez, PTA president, along with Racheal Davis, a Magnolia School District counselor, coordinated their first Fathers Night last Tuesday, to reach out to dads and help them get involved in their children's education. The event included speakers Matthew Morrison, a fifth-sixth grade combination teacher, Deputy David Rios from the Orange County Sheriffs Department, and Ralph Figueroa, a community service specialist from Project SAY, who touched on topics from financial help for college to community services available to them. Hernandez and Davis, who both want to see more father involvement, spearheaded the idea and decided to focus only on dads. "" I just noticed how it was mostly the women who would attend parent meetings or conferences,"" Hernandez said. ""Even when I would make phone calls to homes and the fathers answered the phone, they would still say, 'hold on speak to my wife,"" she said. Davis said she wanted to give fathers general information. Davis, who has worked as a district counselor for two years, said children have approached her with various problems, including issues on domestic violence, incarcerated parents and substance abuse at home. ""We want the fathers to know that what they do at home affects their children,"" Davis said, which is why the night included other topics. During the session, Figuero a told the men to watch their alcohol intake around the children. ""Sometimes you even involve your children in alcohol,"" he said. ""You tell them go fetch me a beer without realizing the culture you're creating around you."" For the coordinators of the event, the night was a success even if only 30 fathers showed up. At the end of the session, fathers were polled to see what they thought about the event. Perez, Juan Manuel Figueroa and Octavio Gamez said the evening was great. ""I really liked the information that the sheriff gave us about the city, the financial aid available to children,"" Juan Manuel said. ""I learned a lot and I'm grateful that they did this for us,"" Perez said. If the fathers gave a positive review, the coordinators will hold more informational sessions.",2008,11-Dec
Meeting Max and Maxine,Olivia Maciel,Anaheim Bulletin,english,"There was something "" Udderly "" special at Sunkist Elementary school last Thursday. Students got the opportunity to see a cow during a Dairy Council of California assembly, a program that takes lessons and livestock on the road statewide to t each children about a cow's anatomy, its digestive system, and the role of dairy products in the human diet. The Mobile Dairy Classroom, a classroom on wheels, visited the campus with 2- year-old ""Maxine"" and her 3-month-old bull calf, ""Max."" ""This is a great opportunity for students to learn where milk comes from,"" said Lyoelle Hamilton, PTA vice president, who helped with the event. Third-grader Ariana Castellanos said she woke up early, eager to see a cow. ""I told my mom we were going to have a cow at school, but I don't think she believed me."" The lessons covered California State Curriculum Standards for language, math, science and health education. Steve Miller, the mobile classroom instructor, gave students lessons that were both insightful and fun. When giving them key terms to remember such as ""pasteurize,"" he asked students to participate. ""OK, move your hands over your eyes,"" he said. ""You see, your hand has just 'passed your eyes.'"" Miller also pointed to the top of Maxine's head and asked students what the cow was missing. While students yelled out ""brains"" and ""hair,"" one student cleverly said, ""A hat like yours?"" ""No, it's definitely not a hat. How about horns?"" Miller asked. Sunkist Elementary school students take a closer look at ""Maxine,"" a-Guernsey cow from Bay Meadow Farms. Maxine weighs about 1,200 pounds, eats about 50 pounds of alfalfa and drinks 50 gallons of water a day.",2008,11-Dec

Cantlay rides hot streak,RANDY YOUNOMAN,Anaheim Bulletin,english,"When you're as hot as the weather, you have to keep playing. That seems to be the philosophy adopted by UCLA's Patrick Cantlay as he rides the wave of success in a summer he will always remember. Since overcoming the odds by qualifying for and playing in the U.S. Open as an amateur in June, Cantlay is continuing to capitalize on that momentum. Cantlay, 19, played in his fourth PGA Tour event last month, the RBC Canadian Open, on another sponsor's exemption that was offered after winning low-amateur honors at the U.S. Open and posting top-25 mishes in his next two tour events. In between, the former Servite High star captured the SCGA Amateur Championship at San Gabriel Country Club.

Anaheim Magazine splits in two,Diane Reed,Anaheim Bulletin,english,"""Anaheim Magazine"" has a sleek, new look. The Winter 2004 edition features a glossy, four-color format and four of the city's top chefs on the cover. The magazine no longer contains the city's recreation schedules, however. They are now part of a separate publication called the ""Anaheim Community Services Guide to Activities and Programs."" It has a photo of a woman doing yoga on the cover. The redesigned, quarterly magazines were mailed in November. ""Both publications are mailed to all of the residents of Anaheim,"" City spokesman John Nicoletti said. ""Anaheim Magazine is also mailed to all of the city's businesses. Copies are also available at city facilities such as the libraries and community centers."" Inside the revamped Anaheim Magazine you'll find features and photos on everything from the police department and the Angels to local restaurants and public utilities. ""One of the reasons we have separated the publications is to begin accepting advertising in Anaheim Magazine,"" Nicoletti said. ""It is a new opportunity for us."" The current issue features a profile on the city's new planning director Sheri Vander Dussen and a comprehensive (if slightly out of date) listing of the city's commissions and commissioners. For example, Terrina Picarello, Anaheim Hills' ""Citizen of the Year"" is listed as a current member of the park and recreation commission, even though she relocated to the East Coast months ago. There are also sports stories, Mighty Ducks schedules and a calendar of upcoming events at the Arrowhead Pond, the Anaheim Convention Center, The Grove of Anaheim and the House of Blues. There's only one thing missing. Anaheim Hills is scarcely mentioned. There is a brief on the date for opening ceremonies at the Anaheim Hills Golf Course Clubhouse. But Acting Community Services Director Jack Kudron says that the date listed is questionable. ""There are some things on back-order and we may not be able to hold the opening until February,"" he said. You can also find a couple of Anaheim Hills restaurants mentioned but that's about it. All four chefs featured on the cover and in the center spread are from West Side restaurants - The Anaheim White House, Mr. Stox, Napa Rose and The Catch. ""I think they need to pay a little closer attention to the East End of town,"" Realtor Karyn Schonherz said. ""We have featured Anaheim Hills businesses in the past,"" Nicoletti who is also the magazine's managing editor said. ""We had the president of Boeing on the cover when we did a story on Boeing last year."" ""For me, it's harder to keep track of two magazines people are going to togs it (Anaheim Magazine). When it had the recreation schedule inside we had a reason to hang onto it."" ""I do think it is really lovely. I just don't know what they plan to do with it,"" she added. Hills resident Pam Fraser wondered about the Community Services Guide. ""Why are we advertising yoga classes in Fullerton?"" Fraser asked. ""We have two (yoga) studios right here in Anaheim Hills."" The 2003-04 City budget shows the average cost of Anaheim Magazine to be 32 cents each     the same cost as last year when there was just one publication. It does not show the cost of preparing two separate publications each requiring separate bindery, and mai""Because we began this new format in the middle of our budget year,"" Nicoletti said, Community services pays for a portion of the publication and the public information office pays for a portion."" He added that that would change next year. The City budget shows a circulation for Anaheim Magazine of 122,000. At 32 cents each that amounts to $39,040 for one 56-page magazine. That is the same cost as the previous year. No mention is made of the additional cost to circulate two separate publications of 24 and 40 pages each. The City budget does not specify if postage is included in the unit price. The U.S. Postal Service confirmed, however, that the city mailed two publications in November, each of them to 100,000 people. Anaheim Magazine was sent at the rate of 13.4 cents each, according to the USPS spokesman. That is $13,400 per 100,000 edition. With four editions a year, that is $53,600 annually. The Community Services guide was mailed at the slightly lower rate of 12.8 cents - $12,800 per 100,000 or $51,200 per year. That is a total of $104,800 for postage annually. ""Both publications are done with the assistance of outside consultants,"" Nicoletti said. ""But city departments oversee the editorial control and design."" Bret Colson and Associates and John Price Design are responsible for Anaheim Magazine and the recreation guide is produced with the help of Anaheim Community Publishing. According to Nicoletti the force behind splitting Anaheim Magazine in two was the broad range of the information it previously contained. ""The information contained in the recreation guide and the magazine has become increasingly diverse,"" he said. ""The feeling was that the public was not getting the benefit of the stories and the recreation guide when it was combined."" ""We will continue to focus on citywide issues and look to represent all areas of the city,"" he said.",2009,11-Aug

Will Jamboree and Weir Canyon roads ever meet?,"Michael Mello
",Anaheim Bulletin,english,"Q. Has there been an effort to connect the dead-end of Jamboree Road to Weir Canyon Road? Is it feasible? Too far? Too expensive? It seems to me that the benefits would be enormous. - Diana Davis, Yorba Linda A . This idea is not new. The outdated Thomas Bros, atlas that guides me through Orange County shows a proposed Jamboree Road extension snaking northward in broken lines to meet up with Weir Canyon Road. But it's never happened. For an explanation, I turned to Ed Knight, the assistant community development director for the city of Orange, where Jamboree now ends. He said the Orange County Master Plan of Arterial Highways also planned for Weir Canyon and Jamboree roads to eventually wed one day. ""The city of Orange General Plan also included this highway designation,"" Knight said. Keep in mind that the no-man's land between Orange and Anaheim Hills doesn't belong to the city; it's under the jurisdiction of the county. We'll come back to that later. ""Approval of the current East Orange Planned Community in 2005 reduced overall development in the study area,"" Knight said. ""Traffic studies showed that the extension was no longer needed."" Fewer homes, fewer people with cars in their garagesequals fewer cars on nearby arterial roads. ""Part of the approval process included removing the roadway extension from the city's General Plan,"" Knight said. ""The extension was also removed from the (county's) MPAH and no longer appears as a potential highway."" Roadside attraction: More Californians are taking to the Internet to do business with the Department of Motor Vehicles. According to DMV statistics, drivers did more than 10.5 million transactions with the DMV in 2010, a 12-percent increase over the previous year. Vehicle registrations, easily the most popular online transaction, jumped 11.5 percent to 7.1 million. Online in-iver's license renewals surged 8 percent to 1.03 million in 2010, and half of the agency's 2 million changeof-address notifications were done online. ""Doing business online makes sense for both our customers and the DMV,"" DMV Director George Valverde said in a statement. What the statement doesn't mention is something that could be one of the factors driving customers to the Internet.",2010,17-May
Freeway art cover-up,"Michael Mello
",Anaheim Bulletin,english,"Q. As I drive on the 5 freeway, I see the flower art tiles displayed on the freeway walls. I remember reading about the cost for these tiles - it was in the millions.

I am sure there are more areas. Who do I call? Caltrans? - Georgina Alvarez, Anaheim Hills A. Caltrans paid nearly $1 million in federal grant money several years ago to turn portions of Orange County freeways into fleeting Guggenheims for drivers; The agency installed about 2,400 tiles for about $250 each. MICHAE L MELLO The art was placed in areas where no landscaping is possible because the entire area has been paved over.

When that happens, Caltrans will contact the property owner or the city in question to get the vegetation trimmed, Caltrans spokesman Alex Valdez said. ""We'll contact them and work with them.

I know you can dial 9-1-1 while driving to report emergencies, but 5- 1-1? - Sandra McCanless, Anaheim To start, Caltrans calls those large electronic boards by the side of the freeway,    changeable message signs,    of which well over 200 dot the Southland. If the particular message you recall stayed up for one hour, then more than 7,500 motorists likely viewed it heading north. They might have wondered the same thing: Can you call 5-1-1 while moving?    Technically, no, because that   s still operational use of the telephone for non-emergency purposes,    says Denise Quesada, a California Highway Patrol officer and spokeswoman.    Obviously, if you have    blue tooth    or another hands-free device, then you are free to make the call. But to actually hold the phone up to your ear or even have it in your hand with the speakerphone on is illegal, because calling 5-1-1 ",2011,15-Dec

Mercedes lot near 91 gets OK to grow,ERIC CARPENTER,Anaheim Bulletin,english,"A Mercedes-Benz dealership next to the 91 freeway sits virtually empty for now but will soon undergo a major expansion. Nearby residents initially fought the dealership   s growth, saying it will create more noise and pollution and choke local streets with traffic. But after the Anaheim Planning Commission approved the expansion plans with a 6-0 vote last month, leaders of the opposition decided against filing an appeal to the City Council. Caliber Motors Co. of Anaheim plans to build a four-level, 115,000-square-foot building that will serve as a parts department and service bay on the six-acre site at 2 0 0 N. Via Cortez, just southeast of the 91 and Imperial Highway. It will also expand an existing sales building by 7,500 square feet. Previously, the location, wedged between the 91 and a housing tract, only served as a sales location for Caliber Motors, which operates a full-service dealership less than two miles away on La Palma Avenue. Z When initial construction was approved for the Via Cortez sitt fiye years ago, owners said it wouldn   t include any tall buildings or light poles or any service bays because of the potential disruption to residential neighbors. But now dealership officials say that the Via Cortez site can   t operate as a sales-only location.    It   s like having a house without a kitchen,    said Don Bering, chief financial officer for the Mercedes dealership.    In order to be successful, we need to be a full dealership - and that means having service bays. Once the construction is complete, the location will include a four-level building - one level underground - that will rise 42 feet. Because of neighbors    concerns, the top level will include a 5-foot parapet for privacy - so employees can   t look down into adjacent yards. Deliveries to the dealership, initially planned for 2 a.m. daily, will be limited to daytime hours after 6:30 a.m. And Mercedes has pledged to donate $25,000 to the adjacent homeowners    association to  the dealership and the freeway. Some in the 107-home Canyon Oaks development said they are still most concerned by the estimated 1,700 additional daily car trips expected to be generated by the expansion. City traffic engineers say the street can handle the additional traffic with some restriping and re-timed traffic lights. Bering said his company still must work out some right-of-way issues with Caltrans and shore up other permits. So construction likely won   t begin at the Via Cortez site until early 2013 and will likely take a year. Are-opening isn   t expected until spring 2014. ",2011,15-Dec

Skateboarders find a home on Mondays at First Baptist Church,A. Trafford Tempieton,Anaheim Bulletin,english,"Skateboarders usually have to find their own places to skate. Most places, like the steps of City Hall, officially are off-limits and the police try to keep them away. Some skateboarders travel to cities such as Huntington Beach that have areas open to the public that skaters can use. But every Monday night there is a central area in Anaheim for skateboarders to come     and their numbers have been growing every week. They've been coming to the First Baptist Church on Broad way near Citron Street, where the church's parking lot is converted into a skate park, complete with ramps for jumps and benches and rails for grinding. More than skateboarders, ranging in age from 5 to 27, attended on Monday, which featured a contest with prizes such as a new skateboard, supplies and T-shirts. It's a far cry from when the program started six weeks""When we first started out, there were about 10 or so kids here,"" said Art Garabedian, who the Skate This skateboard a few blocks away. ""It's really picked up interest the last few weeks and it continues to keep growing:.''.. Garabedian opened Skate This two months ago. His three sons are all skateboarders. After having to travel out of town to buy clothes and equipment for them, he realized there was a market for a skateboard shop in Anaheim. ""We figured that we might as well keep the money in the city,"" said his wife Bonnie. ""We've spent our whole lives in Anaheim and there's a need for something like this."" Skateboarders sometimes have a bad reputation because people have misconceptions about what they are doing, said Tim Dye, 17, who works at Skate This. ""They think that all, doing is vandalizing,"" he said, ""when really we want a place to skate."" The-ramps and rails that are used come from a variety of sources. Some belong to the church, some come from the Garabedian's back yard and others are the leftovers of Mario Martinez, a skateboard promoter who helped organize the program. Youth coordinators from the church help run the skate night. They ask participants to watch their language, but otherwise let them have their freedom to skate. You don't have to belong to the church to skate or even go to church. ""It's not really weird to come here,"" Dye said. ""It's just a place to skate."" Places to skate have been hard comedy locally. But Bonnie Garabedian said the police have been very receptive about the skate night at the church. ""They think it's a great way to get the kids off the street,"" she said. And as far as the Garabedians are concerned, skating in Anaheim is going to be around for a long time and they are in it for the long haul. ""I'm not a skateboarder, but I don't try to pretend with the kids that I am,"" Art Garabedian said. ""But we're going to make most of our business on the tourists so we can always try to do something for these kids in the city.""",2011,15-Dec

Young group hopes picnic can ignite positive feelings,ERIC CARPENTER,Anaheim Bulletin,english,"Children lined up under the shade of canopies at Pearson Park on Sunday to get their faces painted, get a free soda and take part in a scavenger hunt. All the activities were arranged for a common goal; to spark more community activism and voter engagement. After weeks of community unrest and protests in Anaheim, the group of community-minded volunteers known as We Are Anaheim, Somos Anaheim decided it was time for a picnic. A simple picnic in the park, organizers said, was a good way for neighbors to come out of their homes and begin talking about where they want to see Anaheim go from here.    This is just about getting the community to come out and meet each other and getting them to come together to show their support for our city, even if they don   t agree on issues,    said Veronica Rodarte, 25, a nonprofit employee and lifelong Anaheim resident. We Are Anaheim, Somos Anaheim was the brainchild of a small group of twenty something and thirtysom heim residents who saw protesters clash e City Hall on July 24. They wanted to provide a peaceful alternative to encourage dialogue. So they founded their group on Facebook and arranged a peace march, then a kids art project on Anna Drive - the street where a police shooting touched off the community unrest.    We   ve seen a lot of adults feel like they are past the point of being able to make a difference politically, so we focus on the children - the future - to give them the tools to speak up,    Rodarte said. Juan Alvarez, 31, a teacher at South Junior High School, said he hopes the idea of a community picnic to get residents chatting about the future of the city - in a nonthreatening setting - will catch on in other parts of the city. The turnout on Sunday was light - about 50 people.    I consider it a good start,    said a smiling Elsa Covarrubias, 30, a leader of the group sitting under a sign that read    Be the Change.       We are a nonpartisan group,    she said.    We don  e out and to vote - to show they care. ",2012,23-Aug
Why would anyone think I   m not se,CORKY CARROLL,Anaheim Bulletin,english,"Through the seemingly centuries that I have been involved in surfing and the surfing industry, I have done many things. Aside from being a professional surfer and all the blah that goes along with that, I have also done 4 ; many other duties, will have designed surfboards, surf wear and wetsuits along with formulating my own blends of surfboard wax and, more recently, Cork   s Paradise Blend Coffee. I spent 10 years as advertising director at Surfer Magazine as well as being a contributing writer on and off since the 1960s. Plus there was co-founding and starting our local Corky Carroll Surf School along with my pal and partner, Rick Walker. But one thing I have never done, and get asked about often, is own and operate my own surf shop. I have managed a few: CORKY CARROLL FOR THE REGISTER Hobies in Dana Point, Windansea on Main Street in Huntington as well as the longboard store at Huntington Surf & Sport. So why have I never opened my own? The fact is, I almost did. I had everything in line to open Cor Surf Center right here in downtown Huntington Beach back in the mid-1990s. I had been managing the Windansea shop on the corner one block up on Main Street. In the few years that I was in charge, I more than tripled the stores gross income. Then the owner, a dude named Jack Tin, decided he wanted to move the business to San Diego. Why, I have no idea. He had a great location, and the shop was kicking butt. But he did. I had mentioned to the owner of the building that, in the event Jack ever decided to leave, I would like to be first in line to take over or obtain a new lease. We had an understanding on that. So, when Jack informed me he was moving I contacted the owner of the building and told him that I would be ready to take over the building the day that Jack left. He seemed fine with that. So f went out and started putting together some startup money and arranging for what brands I would carry, etc. etc. I wanted to have as little down time as possible while I was redoing the shop and getting my own signs up. Then one day the owner of the building came in as said that he had decided to split the shop in two, and in one side his son was going to open a    Limpys    or    Lumpies   , Somekind of sandwich shop. I was not real stoked about that but figured that even with half the space I could still do very well there. I asked him for the corner half, and he told me he would get back to me. A bit later he got back to me to tell me he had not made a decision on which half it would be what but that he was doubling the rent on what Jack Flynn had paid for either half. Once again I was not real stoked, but STILL felt I would be OK with that. Then Jack moved and I did not hear anything. I put in calls but got no answers. I was all ready to go and was just waiting on getting a lease and keys. Until one day-when I was walking past and saw an    Intent to do business    sign in the window. WHAT WAS THIS? When I finally reached to owner, he acted totally surprised and said that he rention was,    Oh, we really didn   t think you were serious.    Didn   t think I was serious? After I had agreed to only get half the space? After I had agreed to pay twice the rent for half the space? How freaking serious did it take? So that is why I never opened my own surf shop.

Council backs mayor   s charity-foundatio,Jaime Elynn Fletcher,Anaheim Bulletin,english,"Huntington Beach officials will look at creating a city foundation that would promote giving and support local nonprofits. Mayor Don Hansen at the City Council meeting on Monday presented his initial plan for founding the Huntington Beach Foundation, and it received unanimous support from the council without discussion. The foundation would serve as an umbrella organization that would assist and promote various nonprofits that serve Huntington Beach, Hansen said in his report. Hansen directed City Attorney Jennifer McGrath to write up bylaws for the foundation and prepare the paperwork to incorporate the proposed nonprofit. The foundation would have seven directors, and each council member is expected to nominate someone who would serve as the first directors of the corporation. More detailed plans for the nonprofit are expected to come back to the council at a later meeting.",2012,23-Aug
Lifetime angler shares passion through Harbour group,EVA KILGORE,Anaheim Bulletin,english,"Many children boarding the 80-foot chartered boat had never been fishing. Most hadn   t ever been on a boat. Kathy and Bruce Bayless, along with the Anglers of Huntington Harbour, made sure each child had an experience to remember. The Anglers began taking disadvantaged children on a kid   s fishing trip in 1971. The tradition has continued ever since.    The Freelance boat is chartered out of Davey   s Locker in Newport Beach,    said Kathy Bayless.    My husband Bruce and 1, along with the Anglers, get on board at 7 a.m. to set up rods and put hooks on lines as about 50 at-risk boys and girls from Huntington Beach schools arrive on buses chartered by the Anglers.    Bayless says the children range in age from 8 to 15.    The purpose of the trip is for the children to catch fish, so the captain goes to different fishing areas between Huntington Beach and Catalina, depending on where the fish are biting. The boat leaves about 8 a.m. and returns about 4 p.m. nter a dozen Anglers instructing the children, and they make sure each child is successful.    They help the children bait hooks and catch fish,    said Bayless. On this summer   s trip, the children caught barracuda, sand bass, sculpin and sand dabs,    There is a trophy for most unusual, and through the years, kids have struggled for 15 or 20 minutes trying to reel in a fish that turned out to be a rock, a piece of driftwood, and even seaweed.    The largest fish, says Bayless, was a barracuda more than 50 inches long.    At the start of the day, some of the children are a little apprehensive and hesitant to try fishing for the first time,    said Bayless.    After some Angler encouragement and instruction, they catch that first fish and then are baiting hooks and getting them in the water as fast as they can.    Bayless says she grew up in a family of fishers, started fishing when she was about 5 years old, and caught her first marlin by the time she was en we got married 38 years ago,    said Bayless. In addition to fishing activities with the Anglers of Huntington Harbour, the couple tries to get to Cabo San Lucas to do some marlin fishing every year.    We   ve also participated in seven fishing trips to East Cape with the Harbour Rod and Reel Club,    said Bayless. Kathy and Bruce Bayless own the Bayless Group residential and investment real estate company and moved to Huntington Harbour 13 years ago from Fullerton to live on the water and be closer to boating and fishing. They enjoy taking family, friends and clients on their Duffy boat, the Just in Time. And we love the kids    fishing trip each year,    said Bayless.    On this year   s summer trip, the children caught 173 fish. The crew clean and bag each child   s fish to take home.    Bayless says a photo is taken of each child catching a fish, and the photo is also taken home.    I take each photo and print it on board,    saidgton Harbour commemorative T-shirt or hat, breakfast, lunch, beverages and snacks.    This trip is used as an incentive to motivate children who are falling behind to get back on track,    said Bayless.    Dr. Paul Morrow, principal of Marina High School, told me the Anglers    kids    fishing trip has become a life-changing event that adds joy and meaning to the lives of these atrisk children.    Trophies are awarded for jackpot fish, boys heaviest sack, girls heaviest sack, second largest, third largest, most unusual, sportsmanship, and more, explained Bayless.    This year, Bruce invited Raymond Fuentes, the CEO and founder of Rosa Packs on the trip, and he donated five eco-friendly Rosa Pack backpacks to the top boys and girls fishermen of the day,    said Bayless. Bayless says she and her husband joined the Anglers of Huntington Harbour to support the many philanthropies such as Harbour Ocean Preservation Enhancement, operating the white sea bass grow-out pon, preservation and enhancement of marine environment by contributing to the research, education and safeguarding of natural resources, allowing the continuation of sport fishing on our coast.    There are many additional activities, tournaments, TGIF events the last Friday of the month, cruises, and an annual fish fry,    said Bayless. And, of course the Angler   s kids    fishing trip.    My husband Bruce and I believe in enriching the lives of children, and want to support this philanthropy,    said Bayless.   ",2012,23-Aug
H.B. residents pay pennies per police officer,TERI SFORZA,Anaheim Bulletin,english,"Huntington Beach police officers are among the best-compensated in the county, though on a per capita basis, the cost per officer is one of the lowest in the county. There has been a lot of also out the cost of public safety lately, which consumes the lion   s share of just about every city   s budget, and is a spot some cities are eyeing for savings. So it was with great interest that we perused a list ranking O.C.   s police departments - in order of total compensation. Which city   s officers do you think are compensated most handsomely? If you guessed the biggest cities - Anaheim or Santa Ana - you   d be wrong. Clocking in at No. 1 on the list is Costa Mesa, where top base monthly salary was $8,329 a month. Add in things like benefits and special pay, and total compensation was $13,998 per month. No. 2 was the county   s largest law enforcement organization - the Orange County Sheriffs Department, which provides service to a dozen cities as well as the unincorporated athly salary for sheriffs deputies was $7,308, with total comp of $13,968. Rounding out the top three was Huntington Beach, where top base monthly salary was $7,274, with total comp of $13,966. It   s a bit surprising to see little Seal Beach, Placentia and Cypress (coming in at Nos. 7, 8 and 9, respectively) spending more on total comp than much larger cities like Garden Grove, Orange, Santa Ana and Fullerton (Nos. 10,11,12 and 13). These numbers are drawn from a survey done by the Association of California Cities - Orange County, a sort of conservative break-away group from the League of California Cities, which lobbies on behalf of the burgs in Sacramento. They   re a matter of much discussion in Placentia - where negotiations over a new police contract have hit a brick wall and a mediator is being called in. The sticking point: Whether officers will pay part of their 9 percent    employee    share of the pension contribution. PER CAPITA we know that the burden rests more lightly on y than on the shoulders of the few. And the smaller the police department, generally, the more it costs each Joe Citizen to pay the bill. Here are the cities where Joe Citizen carries the heaviest burden: For every person in little Los Alamitos, it costs more than $1 a month to pay this officer. In La Palma, it   s 70 cents. Seal Beach is 54 cents; Laguna Beach, 50 cents; Placentia and Cypress, 25 cents. Now, compare that with the bigger departments, which can spread the costs over more people. These are the cities with the lightest burden: It costs Huntington Beach residents 7 cents each to pay the police officer. Irvine residents pay 6 cents. Anaheim residents pay 4 cents. And the lowest per-capita costs goes to the cities and areas served by the secondmost-handsomely-paid department: The Orange County Sheriffs Department. Folks in the dozen contract cities, and the county   s unincorporated areas, pay just 2",2012,23-Aug
Smiley face in the road is a happy sight,David Rizzo,Anaheim Bulletin,english,"Whenever I stop at the corner of Bastanchury and Associated roads in Fullerton. I look down and see the smiley faces the road crew painted within the round wire circles that trip the signals. It always brings a smile, but I wonder, who put them there? Greg Beers, Yorbe Limfa A. Rest assured that the Fullerton public works department had no hand in the tagging.    We try to make people happy here in the city of Fullerton says Mark Miller. Fullerton   s traffic engineer.    But I   m not aware of any    happy faces    that the city laid down at that intersection or anywhere else.

DAVID RIZZO OR THE REGISTER    There might be some old circular loops, but they are no longer used,    Miller says.    If someone drew a happy face in them, well, cheers to them.    Nov. 26 my wife and I were driving home around midnight on the westba stop because the northbound transition road was closed for construction. Would it have killed them to notify us of the closure sooner so we could have exited early? Me Estrada, Brea A. According to Laura Schapar, a spokeswoman for the Orange County Tranirtation Authority, that closure was not part of the 57 freeway improvement project    I talked to Caltrans, and they had no scheduled closures for that evening, either,    Scheper says.    They only thing they know is that there was an accident near that area, which could have caused the problem.    Scheper adds,    Construction alerts are published on Fridays regarding work taking place the following week. Go to find a map that shows which freeways are under construction. Keep in mind that often the contractor hired to do the work for OCTA or Caltrans may have to delay or advance a work schedilue for reasons outside the contractor   s control. Three homeless men killed while sleeping Three homeless men have been stabbed tcent weeks, raising alarm in police departments and homely camps as investigators try to determine whether any single motive links the killings. The men were all stabbed multiple times as the slept alone. Police posted bulletins at homeless shelters describing the killings as remarkably similar,    but said it was still too early to say whether anything more than the men   s homelessness connected their deaths. They asked that anyone with information call the Anaheim Police Department at 714-765-1944 or email detectives at htf@anaheim.net. Homeless people said the killings have only underscored a rule of life on the streets.    Nobody here sleeps alone,    said Sherissa Houston, 49, who lives around Anaheim   s La Palma PSrk.    Nobody here stays alone Always.     The body of the first of the three victims was found on Dec. 21 at a shopping center in Placentia, not far from a park; he was identified as James Mc Gulivray, 53. One week later, another body was found on tway; he was identified as Lloyd Middaugh, 42. The body of the third victim was found late Friday afternoon at the bottom of a stairwell behind the Yorba Linda library. He was identified as Pauhas Cornelius Smit, 57 . Police have declined to release a grainy surveillance ( that shows a thin man dressed in black lying in wait and then stabbing McGillivray, the first victim. Placentia police initially described the man in the video as 18 to 25 years old, 5-foot-6 to 5- foot-9.    We are not certain that there is only one suspect,    Anaheim police Sgt Bob Dunii said. Investigators have not found any link between the three murders, he said, except that the victims were all homeless men and were all stabbed to death. ' Police have increased their patrols in places where hornless peopte are known to stay Pohce in Placentia, Anaheim and Yorba Linda have formed a task force to investigate the killings, joined by the Orange County lieriffs Department. Police also have circulated warning fliers in homeless mmunities throughout Orange County -    to make them aware they are apparent targets of these attacks,    Dunn said. The fliers advise homeless people not to sleep or camp in dark, secluded areas. They also warn them to stay together and keep aware of their surroundings. - Doug Iiving high schools get Grammy recognition Western High School and Esperanza High have been announced as a two of the 125 semifinalist in the Grammy Signature Schools program.

Abdominal fat reducer provided to Hoiiywood stars by famous piastic surgeon now avaiiabie to pubiic,Dr. Frank Ryan,Anaheim Bulletin,english,"An advanced line of products used by famous Beverly Hills plastic surgeon Dr. Frank Ryan is now available to the public. Recently these products had been made available to Dr. Ryan's clients which included Oar winning Hollywood movie stars and celecties across the naticMi. These products help substantially improve personal appearance without plastic surgery. Dr. Ryan, perhaps the most famous Hollywood plastic surgeon in recent times, was extensively featured on television and in magazines across the nation. Dr. Ryan was also one of the first professional staff members of Endless Youth and Life which provides products and services that make celebrities look and perform many years younger than their age. On August 16, 2010 Dr. Ryan died in a tragic car accident on the Pacific Coast Highway near his ranch in Malibu. It was Dr. Ryan' s wishes that Endless Youth and Life would make his advanced non-surgical product line available to the public in the future. Endless Youth and Life is now complying with Dr. Ryan's wishes. The first product being offered to the public is I>r. Ryan's non-surgical personal appearance enhancement product. Dr. Frank Ryan's Abdominal Fat Reducer. Abdominal fat is the most stubborn fat to reduce and it is also the most hazardous fat to health. Abdominal fat produces destructive hormones that spread throughout the body. A pilot clinical study demonstrated that Dr. Frank Ryan's Abdominal Fat Reducer can support reducing your potbelly. A double blind clinical study was conducted on Dr. Frank Ryan's Abdominal Fat Reducer. The study on ""Abgone Extra Strength"" subsequently endorsed by Dr. Ryan was com- missioned by Advanced Supplement Research and used a research group which currently has an expert staff consisting of more than 32 board-certified Iysician investigators and more than 38 ACRP certified clinical research coordinators. This group conducts clinical studies for the (drug companies. While diet and exercise support weight loss, the formula in Dr. Ryan's Abdominal Fat Reducer demonstrates promising support for weight loss as well. The Dr. Ryan group had results in the right direction showing a promising reduction in weight. The weight loss was numericy larger than the changes in the group taking the placebo. At week 4, the test subjects in the study lost weight and enhanced their overall appearance (by reducing their pot belly) compared to the group that did not take Dr. Ryan's Abdominal Fat Reducer. Both groups were given the same dietary instructions and continued thier normal physical routine and did not do additional exercise. In addition at week 8, the study showed that Dr. Frank Ryan's Abdominal Fat Reducer increased resting metabolic rate (calorie burning) so that you lose weight faster. And, the study found that the all natural Dr. Frank Ryan's Abdominal Fat Reducer pill produced weight loss safely. How does Dr. Frank Ryan's Abdominal Fat Reducer work? It was found in a number of research studies on laboratory animals and later confirmed in human studies, that a substance called Conjugated Linoleic Acid (CLA) decreases abdominal body fat in three ways: 1.) CLA decreases abdominal body fat mass by decreasing the amount of abdominal fat that is stored after eating; 2.) CLA increases the rate of fat breakdown in abdominal fat cells; and 3.) CLA increases the rate of abdominal fat metabolism which decreases the total number of fat cells. You can think of CLA as a match that lights the fuse in abdominal fat. This fuse also increases metabolic rate that can result in more fat loss. Dr. Frank Ryan's Abdominal Fat Reducer contains the effective dose of CLA. CLA interferes with an enzyme called lipoprotein lipase (LPL). LPL is an enzyme that helps store fat in the body. So, by inhibiting this fat-storing enzyme LPL, CLA can help reduce the re-accumulation of fat. (XA also helps the body use its existing abdominal fat for energy, thereby increasing fat oxidition and energy expendit me Dr. Frank Ryan's Abdominal Fat Reducer also contains other super highly advanced all natural ingredients that help reduce abdominal fat. Of course, a healthy diet and exercise program, along with Dr. Ryan's Abdominal Fat Reducer, could result in even greater results. Studies have shown that Dr. Frank Ryan's Abdominal Fat Reduca ingredients increase the rate of fat metabolism, which reduces both surface and intestinal abdominal fat and helps inhibit future formation of these abdominal fats. ' One of the ingredients is a very high quality and potent extract of green tea. This extract is EGCG, which has been shown in clinical studies to quickly increase metabolism which helps to reduce abdominal body fat over time. These ingredients start working in 20 minutes and were clinically measured at 60 minutes and at 120 minutes to increase calorie burning, which is the first step to reducing the pot belly.

August events designed to make Analieim safer,BILL RAMS,Anaheim Bulletin,english,"The Anaheim Police Department offers residents a number of ways to get involved in the fight against crime. This month, the department hosted and participated in a number of events designed to foster partnerships and keep the community safe, beginning Aug. 6 at the annual National Night Out against crime. The event included the whiz-bang aspects of policing with crowd-pleasing demonstrations by the K-9, SWAT and Angel helicopter units. It also featured outstanding examples of the nuts-and-bolts of community policing: officers interacting with citizens and sharing ways they can get involved, such as the P.A.C.E. Citizen Academy, Junior Cadets and Neighborhood Watch. Hundreds of residents packed Eucalyptus Park to learn about police work and to support those who keep Anaheim safe.    My kids always see police officers in uniforms, so this event is a nice way for them to develop relationships with officers,    said resident Margaret Lloyd. Two days later, on Aug. 8, several police leaders attended a eremony for 32 students of the Project Access Hermosa Village Center. The six-week program taught children about conflict resolution, interpersonal skills and the pitfalls of bullying.    I make it a point to stress family at these events because that   s where it all starts,    said interim Police Chief Raul Quezada, who spoke at the graduation.    A strong family at home goes a long way in making our jobs easier.    Finally, the Police Department   s inaugural gun buyback is scheduled for Aug. 24 at La Palma Park. The idea: fewer guns on the streets make Anaheim safer for police and citizens. So far this year; there have been four gun-related gang killings and 13 gun-related assaults.    Too frequently, people fall victim to gun violence,    Sgt. Bob Dunn said.    Our investigations often reveal the guns used in violent crimes come from burglaries where unsecured guns are the target.    No identification is required for the buyback, and no questionbetween 8 a.m. and 4 p.m. with your unloaded gun or rifle. The police will pay $100 for handguns and $200 for rifles. - Bill Rams is a former Orange County Register reporter who owns a boutique communications company. ",2013,01-Aug

One day while working on the house, I was delighted to see three artists had set up their easels on the sidewalk and began sketching and watercoloring my house under construction. 1 went out to talk to the artists and found out that it was Anaheim resident Don May working with two students. May was a well-known artist who painted Christmas cards for the Hilton Hotel Corporation. One of his students was Mrs. Ganahl, the matriarch of Ganahl Lumber. For years I wondered what became of those three paintings of my house under construction. I knew May and Ganahl had both passed away, and 1 wondered if 1 would ever find any of those paintings. I even went to an estate sale at Don May   s house, thinking maybe there would be some clues. Nothing ever turned up. About a years ago, I was at the Placentia Woodcarvers weekly gathering and I was telling themembers about the grand opening of Anaheim   s Founders Park. As I was describing the park, Judy Broberg, the woman sitting next to me, asked if that was where the old Red Cross Building was located because a long time ago she had painted it in an art class. Right away, 1 asked Broberg if by any chance she had taken a class from Don May. She said yes. I asked her if Mrs. Ganahl was in the class. Again, she said yes. But she wasn   t the one who sat on North Street in Anaheim, painting a house under co""But maybe it was my neighbor,    she suggested. Broberg immediately placed a phone call to her neighbor. Sue Hartmann. After a bit of back and forth, Hartmann asked,    Was the house under construction, and was there a little photo of her house in the Sunset magazine in the letters to the editor section?    1 started jumping up and down. Yes! Yes! That was it. Hartmann thought she still had the painting of my house under construction in her portfolio. A week later, she met me at my carving class and presented me with her painting. It was a miracle! To think that after all these years, 1 finally met the second student who set up her easel infiont of my house some 20 years ago - and I now had possession of one of the paintings. Hartmann did watercolors of many historical homes in Anaheim when she was a student of Don May. She is now in the process of placing her paintings with current homeowners who would appreciate her artistic renditions. - Jill Worley is a retired school teacher amilife loneim.",2013,01-Aug

Anaheim is hit with legal claims over summer unrest,ALEJANDRA MOLINA,Anaheim Bulletin,english,"Police actions escalated tension and put bystanders in harm   s way in the moments after officers shot and killed an unarmed man who had run from them, according to legal claims filed against the city. Eight residents of Anna Drive filed claims, seeking $500,000 each for physical injuries, emotional trauma, violations of constitutional protections against unreasonable search and seizure and other damages. The claims were filed Friday and Tuesday, city officials said. The city has 45 days to respond; if it denies the claims, the residents may file lawsuits.    All claims will be seriously looked at,    said Mayor Tom Tait, who had not seen the claims as of Tuesday. Sgt. Bob Dunn of the Anaheim Police Department said he could not comment. Representatives from the city attorney   s office did not respond to requests for comment.

Shouting began, as neighbors called on officers to help Diaz. Officers responded with    conflicting and incoherent    orders, according to the claims, then brought out batons and fired rubber bullets and pepper bullets to control the crowd.    In this case, police didn   t follow good procedure, and they turned a bad situation worse,    said Dana Douglas, the attorney representing the eight Anna Drive residents as well as Diaz's family in a separate lawsuit.

Genie invents topical jokes for stage show,SARAH TULLY,Anaheim Bulletin,english,"Gangnam Style, the Kardashians and Lady Gaga weren   t part of the national conversation   when the stage show    Aladdin    debuted a decade ago. Facebook hadn   t even started. But now, all those topics and more are part of the musical production at Disney   s California Adventure, thanks to the Genie. The seven actors who play the Genie in    Aladdin - A Musical Spectacular    get wide leeway to invent current jokes for the show. Russ Marchand, who has played the Genie for nine years, said Disney doesn   t require him to present jokes ahead of time. He adds something new to the show, either a joke or a gesture, every week - as long as it goes along with the story.    The things that would get me in trouble on other shows, they require on this one,    said Marchand, 34, of Costa Mesa, the longest-tenured actor in the Genie role Marchand regularly reads gossip websites and watches entertainment news shows such as    Access Hollywood  cher Genies.

The original Genie was Robin Williams, who Actor Russ Marchand, 34, of Costa Mesa has played the Genie for nine years voiced the character in the 1992 movie.

"Church, businesses clash over activities",REBECCA KHEEL,Anaheim Bulletin,english,"A church in an Anaheim Hills industrial park is butting heads with other businesses in the area as it readies to host concerts and classes for the community (  race OC Church wants to add new activities such music lessons, concerts and conferences to its offerings and has gotten a city permit to do so. But other businesses in the park are fighting the request, saying the young parishioners some activities are geared toward would be unsafe at night in the dark, secluded area. In 2008, Grace OC, a 100- member church on East Crystal Drive, was permitted to hold services Sundays from 9 to 11:30 a.m., other Sunday activities until 8 p.m. and Bible study on weeknights from 7 to 9 p.m. The original permit was granted based on the church operating while other businesses were closed so that there would be enough parking, said Sheri Vander Dussen, Anaheim city planning director. Because of the conditions of the original permit, the church needed to apply to amend   is permit. In November, Anaheim   s Plann improved the amended permit. But the Crystal Savi Industrial ( enter Owners Association quickly filed an appeal, requiring the City Council to step in and make a decision about the permit. The council unanimously approved the permit last week.    The Planning Commission continued to find that there was adequate parking and that those uses are not incompatible with surrounding land uses,    Vander ) ussen said. The new permit allows for Sunday services from 9:30 a.m. to 12:30 p.m. and 1 to 6 p.m., with some services lasting until 10 p.m.; Monday and Wednesday bible study from 6 to 10 p.m. or services from 7 to 10 p.m.; Tuesday and Thursday music lessons from   1 to 7 p.m.; Tuesday and Thursday services or Bible study from 7 to 10 p.m.; and Friday and Saturday youth nights featuring live music from 7 to II p.m. The new activities won   t be able to begin until a few condition are met, Vander Dussen said. First, the church needs to submit a plan to the Anaheim Police Department demonst raficient lighting, to ensure the safety of people coming to the night activities. The owners association also asked for a traffic study, but the city   s requirements for a traffic study were not met, Vander I ) ussen said.    Traffic studies are only required when an activity would result in 100 trips per hour during peak after noon hours. Second, the church needs to secure the parking. The church itself does not have enough parking to meet the requirements of the permit. The church, run by senior pastor Randy Woolstrum, proposed agreements with adjacent businesses to use their parking. But the owners association said the church can only get the parking by going into an agreement with the association. That   s because creating a hodgepodge of parking agreements could pose a safety risk, said Michael Ellis, an officer of the association and president of Coast Pneumatics.     We offered Randy parking,    Ellis said.    Randy chose not to take the parking.    This week, ed to start mediation over the parking. Should the church be denied parking, the amended permit approved by the city will be moot. The owners association   s opposition to the church   s new activities comes down to safety, Ellis said. He said the association would be fine with expansion of activities for adults during the day. But young teenagers should not be walking around at night, in a poorly lit area with few sidewalks, he said.    A 14-year-old child in a cornfield, it   s a movie really. It   s that scary,    Ellis said, referring to an adjacent five-acre field that alternates between growing strawberries and corn. But Woolstrum, also a member of the owners association   s board of directors, said that reasoning is a cover for the association   s real problem: It doesn   t want a church in the complex.    They don   t want a church, and they   re trying to think of a politically correct way to say it,    Woolstrum said. In r away the rights of the individual businesses to control their own parking. The businesses right next to the church know what the church is trying to do, he said, and have no issues with it. Furthermore, the church already has agreements to use other businesses    parking from its 2008 permit, he said. The parking the association offered came with a multitude of conditions, Woolstrum said.    Those included paying for parking, never selling the church to another church and signing a document that said if the church were a nuisance it would leave, he said. Grace OC Church is adding the new activities because it   s always been part of the church   s plans, Woolstrum said, and they also benefit the community.    The things we do, we do for the community,    he said.    The thing",2013,01-Aug
"NAMM's spending, excitement are music to our ears",TANYA LA SOYA,Anaheim Bulletin,english,"Each January, Anaheim rings in the new year with the National Association of Music Merchants, and today the tradition continues as NAMM 2013 opens, bringing nearly 100,000 visitors for this four-day trade show. It is not open to the public. NAMM moved to Anaheim in 1976, and the Anaheim Convention Center soon became the place for music lovers to gather. For 35 years, the annual NAMM event has presented the city with an awesome opportunity to welcome visitors from across the nation and throughout the world. While most people associate Anaheim with Disneyland, to those in the music industry, Anaheim in January is the music manufacturing capital of the world. If you live, work or play near the Anaheim Resort, the arrival of 100,000 music lovers may mean you   ll encounter vehicle and pedestrian traffic along Harbor Boulevard and Katella Avenue, or the wait at your favorite restaurant may be a bit longer. But from across the street, you   ll definitely hear the sound of live music on concert stages. T   s exhibits and sessions fill the entire Convention Center and overflow with activities in the nearby hotels, including local and national bands appearing each afternoon and evening in the lobbies of the Hilton Anaheim, Anaheim Marriott, Sheraton Park and Hyatt Regency Orange. Anaheim   s convention center campus provides what musicians refer to as the best    hang    of the year. The NAMM Show brings together our community of hoteliers, restaurant and retail personnel, transportation drivers and the staffs of the Convention Center and Visitor & Convention Bureau with a common purpose of delivering the    Anaheim Way    - warm hospitality to Anaheim   s first-time visitors and to returning friends. On Sunday, this fourday gathering of all things music will silence the instruments. We thank NAMM and its attendees for choosing Anaheim as their destination and for contributing what is projected to be approximately $92 million in visitor and attendee spending to the Anaheim and Orange County communities. The NAMM Show represents the single largest economic impact of any one event each year.

Fight for abortion rights remains,"KIMBERLY
SALTER",Anaheim Bulletin,english,"January 22, 1973, was a victorious day for women in the United States. The Roe v. Wade decision by the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that a woman, in consultation with her physician, has a constitutionally protected right to choose abortion in the early stages of pregnancy. Many longtime feminists felt they had finally arrived after trudging up a long, long hill. Little did we know, on that day, things would almost immediately start to gobackwards. While the right to have an abortion is federal law, getting one in the United States in 2013 may be more difficult for the average woman than at any other time in history. In a time when white male politicians say that a woman   s body can resist pregnancy in the case of    legitimate rape    or that pregnancies conceived in rape are    intended by God,    many may look at their cal endars to verify that we are indeed in the year 2013. In 2011, 92 abort ion restrictions were passed in 24 states and in 2012,19 states enacted 43 provisions reervices. So as we    celebrate    (and I use the term hesitantly) the 4()th anniversary of Roe v. Wade, does anyone know where one can obtain an abortion in a timely fashion without mortgaging their house? This era of state restrictions on abortions began in 1992 with the Supreme Court   s decision in Planned Parenthood v. Casey. Although the court up held the basic right to abortion, it also expanded the ability of the states to enact their own restrictions. For 20 years anti-choice politicians have passed laws chipping away at Roe v. Wade and a woman   s right to choose what happens to her own body. These politicians work tirelessly to cur tail access to abortion at every turn. This is happening even though statistics tell us abortion is one of the safest surgical procedures for women in the U.S. Less than 0.5 percent of women experience a complication. In California a woman has the fundamental light to make her own reproductive choices. She has the right to bear a child or to chooserior to the viability of the fetus or when abortion is necessary to preserve the life of the woman. These rights are stated in the 2002 Reproductive Privacy Act, and will stand in the state even if Roe is over turned. If you are a victim of sexual assault and go to an emergency room for treatment, California law requires that hospitals provide you with information about emergency contraception (EC). You do not need to talk to your parents, the police or anyone else before you can be given EC after a sexual assault. In a perfect world there would be no need for abortions, women would not be sexually assaulted, and children would have no need to fear their own family members. But that isn   t the world we live in. So 40 years later, the struggle to preserve access to abortion is even more daunting than the fight to legalize it was. Kimberly Salter is the past president of the California National Organization for Women and the O.C. chapter of NOW. She sits on the board of the Southern California Chapter ofN Women United States National Committee. PRO: THIS IS WHAT THE CITY NEEDS (This is) long overdue. There should be a countywide civilian review board on complaints of police and sheriff. If an officer does his job and follows the rules, then he has nothing to worry about. Many cities such as NYC, Chicago and San Francisco (have had) such civilian review boards in place for decades and police officers on their streets are still able to function and do their jobs. Only now they are doing it better and more professionally. Don   t listen to the naysayers. - Jose Migra, San Clemente I will never defend criminals. Nobody is perfect, and I   m sure AFD isn   t either. The D.A. and this group of 22 community leaders probably don   t want to ruffle (the) PD's feathers. They depend on each other for things, even the community leaders. Who decides who sits at this table? If PI) has nothing to hide, this should not be an issue. Just like dashboard cameras on black and-whites. Accountability! - JoINK OF SOMETHING ELSE As if there is not enough police oversight, the city of Anaheim is considering a citizens review committee. I have a novel idea. Why not promote known gang members    parents to review their children   s behavior? Maybe this review will include searching the property where they live for weapons and drugs on a daily basis. Oh wait, that would require some degree of personal responsibility. This move is less about police oversight and more about pandering to a minority of our community that refuses to take responsibility for the criminals they raise without guidance and consequences. Marty Kuhlmann, Anaheim There are systems in place already to review all deadly force incidents: D.A. reviews, Internal Affairs, the Chiefs Advisory Board, the U.S. attorney and civil court if the victim and or the family so decides to go that route*. Who will pay for this new citizens committee? It shouldn   t be the taxpayers, who already pay for the vast majority of all the other entities . If the existing entities are not enough, then let   s make what we   ve got work, rather than create another new one. - AI Irish Our Police Department should never feel that they are required to do their job with their hands tied behind their backs. If they feel their life, or the life of a citizen, is in danger, they should be able to use any means they deem necessary to stop the threat without constant fear of admonishment and or disciplinary action. - Roy Ho",2013,01-Aug

The speaker was Anaheim Police Departments then-interim Chief Raul Quezada, who recently opened the first-ever meeting of the Chiefs Neighborhood Advisory Council before more than 20 members of the community. The meeting underscores the APD   s goal to form closer ties to residents to make the city safer, make the job of policing more transparent and to make residents of Anaheim feel like they   re more in partnership with the officers whose job is to protect them. Joining Quezada were members of his command staff, who each summarized their responsibilities at the department and talked a little about their professional and personal backgrounds.    I   ve been here for about 32 years,    said Cpt. Bob Conklin, city (and) great department. I   m excited to see the great things we can accomplish together.

If you would have closed your eyes while everyone spoke about their neighborhood, would you have thought it was one city being discussed?    Quezada asked.    You would have thought it was a bunch of cities, but it   s just one.    And we   re just one police department.    Residents who were invited to the event all have maintained consistent activity in their neighborhoods.

Basin at Boeing site to buoy water recycling system,SARAH TULLY,Anaheim Bulletin,english,"A new water basin on part of the former Boeing Co. site is expected to dramatically increase the water recycling program of the Orange Country Water District. The district is buying almost 18 acres for a basin from the Panattoni Development Co., which is constructing nearby industrial buildings where Boeing used to operate. The $28.4 million sale is expected to close later this month, according to the district. The land will be used for a recharge pond in the district   s Groundwater Replenishment System, which turns sewer water into drinking water. The water goes through a series of treatments, ending when it is pumped into basins in Anaheim where it percolates into the groundwater aquifer. The district already runs a series of basins nearby. But the new basin would allow the amount of water recycled to increase from 70 million to IOO million gallons a day, said Michael Markus, the district   s general manager. The basin could start operating early next year on the city   s east side.  eny drop of water we can,    Markus said. The basin will sit behind a monument dedicated to the former Autonetics and Boeing businesses and alongside a diversion channel, hidden from view from the main thoroughfare. The proximity to the channel and the geology make it a good location for a basin, Markus said. The new plan is less dramatic than one proposed six years ago. The district   s board threatened to use eminent domain to take the 102 acres of the Boeing property. City and business officials protested, saying the land should be used for job creation. Instead, the board backed down, deciding to study other locations. In the latest plan, Panattoni opted to put a portion of the land up for sale and made a deal directly with the water district. The district serves more than 2.3 million residents, supplying water to more than 20 cities and wate",2014,09-Jan

Readers are improving travel in North County,Frank Eastman,Anaheim Bulletin,english,"Over the past IO months since I took over this column, I    ve learned a lot from you     our alert readers     about north Orange Country   s varied traffic patterns, pesky potholes, strange freeway onramps And dysfunctional traffic signals. And, thanks to your questions, some serious problems were fixed very quickly Frank Shemanski of Fullertonalerted us to the troublesome    Tintersection    of Rolling Hills Drive and Associated Road that posed a danger to pedestri ART and headed to nearby Craig Regional Park. Shortly afterward , Fullerton made this an all-red intersection, meaning motorists headed in all three directions have to stop for at least a full second every time there   s a signal change. Cadrans quickly fixed a damaged on-ramp meter after it was brought to our attention by Susan Petrolia of Fullerton, making it safer for drivers entering the westbound 91 from Kraemer Boulevard. Your inquiries also have led to more green lights. The Lambert Road onramp merovide a green light during morning hours after Philip Bement of Anaheim noted that minimal traffic was headed in that direction. Additional green time also was given to motorists turning left onto Yorba Linda Boulevard from southbound Kraemer Boulevard in Placentia after Barbara Hemmerling noticed additional traffic due to a nearby street closure. A    No Access to Southbound 55 Freeway    sign was installed after Steve Pena of Yorba Linda noted that vehicles accessing the westbound 91 from Lakeview Avenue in Anaheim had to quickly cut across lanes to reach the 56, often creating a traffic jam. We also were reminded about a few state laws, such as the need to change out of state license plates within 30 days of moving to California, along with the fact that people with disabilities who are issued special parking placards can use them in any vehicle. Thank you, everyone, who wrote letters or called me to ask questions. The greatest reward in writing this column is that real problems are fixed fairecause you brought it to our attention. Pm sure there are many more road-related concerns we   ll be tackling through 2014. Feel free to keep sending those inquiries as we continue our trip on the road.

Fish,Richard Guzman,Anaheim Bulletin,english,"   These are the heaviest stocked lakes around,    he said.    There   s no question about it,    he said.    If anybody ever challenged us, we would be happy to compare stocking receipts, because it would prove, once and for all, who has the most fish.    Elliott also says he stocks the largest fish. He said he has dropped in a couple of hand-picked, 30-pound trout.    We   ll always have your 11/2- to 3-pound fish, which are still big for rainbow trout. On top of that, we will have a mix of what we call our teenagers, which are eight to IO pounds,    Elliott said.    And then we have what we call our super trout, which are IO pounds plus.    Andy Galaviz, 25, a Cal State Fullerton graduate who works for Boeing and lives in Arcadia, has been fishing at Santa Ana River Lakes since high school. He said it   s one of the best fishing holes around.    I normally fish probably four or five times a year on average, and that   s between Mammoth Lakes in the Sierras and down here,    Galaviz said.    But whenever I get a chance to fish down here, this lake and Corona lakes are probably my go-to choices.    He only throws in a line on stocking days.    I personally don   t like wasting my time and showing up when they are not stocking, because it is pretty expensive to fish,    Galaviz said.    I just like to make my time worth it.    Bryan Friedman, 29, of Walnut has been fishing here since he was I O.    My mom dropped me off every day, and I just made friends around the lake,    Friedman said.    But we would always come for onereason: because theyhad the really, really big fish.    At 19, Friedman began manufacturing bait and lures for the Fishing Lakes tackle shop. His Breabased company, Lip Ripper , now distributes to 1,200 locations nationwide. Friedman   s secret weapon against the lakes    sometimes- fickle trout: a doughbait coating, dubbed Hatchery Dust, that he sells.

The basin acts as a natural filter and holding tank for Orange County drinking water.    Our board is committed to providing recreational access to facilities where it makes sense,    Hunt said. (The water district has additional agreements with a waterfowl-hunting concession at Prado Dam and a model-airplane club at another lake in Anaheim.) County maintenance periodically impacts Elliott   s .business: Fishing Lakes was forced to vacate Anaheim Lake this year after it was drained to clear sediment from the lake bed; Elliott will resume business there when the lake is refilled. Over his three decades in the business, Elliott has noticed a steady decline of young anglers. He   s trying to set the hook early with discounted rates and events for kids. He opened Huckleberry Pond, a small, highly stocked pool at Santa Ana River Lakes where customers can catch and purchhas a petting zoo and a goldpanning station.

CITY MASCOT FROM DISNEY SHOWS CHARACTER TRAIT,Lorren Rodriguez,Anaheim Bulletin,english,"Your question made me smile. But I think it might make Andy a little sad that you don   t know him. Who is Andy, you ask? Andy Anaheim, the mascot you   re clearly referring to. He had his heyday in the 1950s and    60s and faded away by the 1980s, replaced by a more modern, some said    more dignified,   logo. But if you ask me, there was nothing more dignified and fun than the forever-smiling face of Andy Anaheim. And in recent years, he   s been experiencing a sort of renaissance thanks to the Anaheim Historical Society. Andy was a gift from Walt Disney - drawn by a Disney cartoonist in the early 1950s     just as Disney was building his amusement park and about to transform Anaheim from a relatively sleepy suburb to an international tourist destination. The A-shaped cartoon was the property of the Chamber of Commerce and appeared on everything from travel brochures to city utility bills (Mr. Anaheim remembers Andy Anaheim on trophies and ribbons awarded through then he was a kid). In 2011, the Historical Society officially reintroduced Andy at one of its events, a push led by former Disney designers Kevin Kidney and Jody Daily. Since then, Andy has made several appearances downtown, was featured on a float in last year   s Halloween Parade and even has his own Facebook page. For me, Andy brings back a lot of fun childhood memories. I   m glad to see his smiling, silly face back in Anaheim. Q. I was thinking, with the recent earthquakes and the fire up in the Glendora area, isn't there some kind of text-alert system the city (Anaheim) has to notify residents in emergency situations? How do I get that? -Thom Johnson, Anaheim A. Yes, Thorn. There is such a system called Anaheim Alert. It was set up several years ago to notify those who live or work in Anaheim of    urgent or emergency situations.    You can sign up to have alerts sent to a home or work email account or to any wireless device such as a cell phone or pager. The alerts would be used such as the earthquake or brush-fire scenarios you mentioned, but they can also keep you alert of any road closures or need to shelter in place if, for instance, there were a nearby chemical spill or search for a police suspect. Here   s an example of a recent alert:    (Jan. IO) Eastbound La Palma between Tustin and Kraemer will be closed for approximately three hours due to a traffic collision. Please plan accordingly.    There is no charge to sign up for the service, although standard text-message rates may apply when sen",2014,09-Jan
PROPOSED CHARTER SCHOOL AIMS FOR EVEN HIGHER GOALS,Claudia Morris,Anaheim Bulletin,english,"GOALS-The pink and red hearts and hand-lettered    I love GOALS    on 9-year-old Meztly Careolla   s GOALS Cadets service T-shirt touched an emotional chord with a packed Anaheim City School District Board hearing room on Jan. 13. Meztly   s picture was featured as part of a GOALS -Growth Opportunities through Athletics, Learning & Service - presentation to advance plans for a GOALS Academy public charter school, along with other positive submissions and comments. The GOALS proposal envisions a small, free public charter school, operated with credentialed teachers, but using additional enrichment, field trips, service learning opportunities, increased arts, sports and athletics, and a high percentage of enrolled students participating in free after- school education and activities. If all goes to plan and careful, constructive collaboration with the local school district proceeds, opening would be as soon as August 2015. The GOALS Academy as conceived will be a kindergarten through eigwith enrollment open to children in the local school districts. The GOALS hope is that the relatively small school anticipated would enroll up to 300 youngsters and help relieve severel mover crowding at the nearby Horace Mann School located just blocks away from the core GOALS facilities in north central Anaheim Along with the expected    boutique    nature of the school would be the integration of substantial additional day time, after- school and community learning programs to bolster the development experience of students and their families. Community leaders, educators and GOALS alumni spoke for more than an hour about the opportunities, virtues and values planned as part of the initiative. Anaheim Mayor Tom Tait, who mentioned he was appearing not in his role as mayor but rather as a private citizen who cared, spoke passionately about the track record of GOALS and the potential that the program had to launch a first-class educational experience through a public charter school.    I love in GOALS too,    said Tait.    And I have believed in them since they started almost 20 years a g o     Anaheim City School District Board members, led by President Jose Moreno, were especially gracious and welcoming, as were senior district staff members in hosting the hearing. On another positive note, GOALS emphasized a substantial planning grant from the California Department of Education that would enable a smooth implementation process to open the GOALS Academy.    I never really knew what being in a caring family was until I joined GOALS,    said Frank Cardona, a program coach and alumnus.    I cannot wait to see how great our extended family can be with this school.    Israel Ramos, another GOALS alumnus who is attending Cal State Fullerton and who began participating in GOALS when he was 9, may have summed up the crowd   s hopes best.    If I have done so much with my life already thanks to showing up once a week in GOALS, imagine what children ugh eighth grade will do with theirs?    - GOALS is a not-for-profit youth-serving program headquarteredin Ana",2014,09-Jan

Basin at Boeing site to buoy water recycling system,SARAH TULLY,Anaheim Bulletin,english,"A new water basin on part of the former Boeing Co. site is expected to dramatically increase the water recycling program of the Orange Country Water District. The district is buying almost 18 acres for a basin from the Panattoni Development Co., which is constructing nearby industrial buildings where Boeing used to operate. The $28.4 million sale is expected to close later this month, according to the district. The land will be used for a recharge pond in the district   s Groundwater Replenishment System, which turns sewer water into drinking water. The water goes through a series of treatments, ending when it is pumped into basins in Anaheim where it percolates into the groundwater aquifer. The district already runs a series of basins nearby. But the new basin would allow the amount of water recycled to increase from 70 million to IOO million gallons a day, said Michael Markus, the district   s general manager. The basin could start operating early next year on the city   s east side.  n y drop of water we can,    Markus said. The basin will sit behind a monument dedicated to the former Autonetics and Boeing businesses and alongside a diversion channel, hidden from view from the main thoroughfare. The proximity to the channel and the geology make it a good location for a basin, Markus said. The new plan is less dramatic than one proposed six years ago. The district   s board threatened to use eminent domain to take the 102 acres of the Boeing property. City and business officials protested, saying the land should be used for job creation. Instead, the board backed down, deciding to study other locations. In the latest plan, Panattoni opted to put a portion of the land up for sale and made a deal directly with the water district. The district serves more than 2.3 million residents, supplying water to more than 20 cities and wate",2014,09-Jan

Many refugees suffer from posttraumatic stress disorder,having seen family members killed in front of them before fleeing their home countries.    Each one, they have a very' fragile case,    Kayali said. Access also serves as a home away from home for many clients. Hazem AlBustani, originally from Iraq, called the office when his mother was dying in the hospital. He had no other relatives in town, so he said that Access was his family. Access ended up helping with funeral costs. AlBustani, a refugee who moved to the United States five years ago, also took citizenship classes for about seven months, taking his oath of citizenship earlier this month. He was one of about six clients who were honored at an event for those who recently passed the citizenship test or had taken the citizenship oath.

Resolving to help those most in need,Tom Tait,Anaheim Bulletin,english,"As a new year begins, many of us resolve to eat better, exercise more and generally take better care of our bodies. As mayor, I have a similar resolution for our city: I want to continue to lead Anaheim to be a healthy community, financially and socially. Financially, we now have a balanced budget but there is more that we can do. We are living within our means but we must be mindful of the temptation of aggressive borrowing and overspending. We need to continue to generate opportunity for new business and job creation. We must be vigilant to ensure that Anaheim   s assets are maximized for the benefit of all our residents, not leveraged with heavy subsidies for the few. I will continue to advocate for the proper use of taxpayer dollars on behalf of every Anaheim resident, as I know that our economic health depends on it. But, just like in our own lives, financial health is only one aspect of better living. Living out our community value as a city of kindness is also a vital part of making our city strond healthier. When we treat our fellow citizens with respect and kindness, the re wards our city will reap are tremendous. One example I can point to is Anaheim   s renewed efforts to address the homeless situation. This is one of north Orange County   s biggest challenges, as we are faced with individuals living in our parks, near freeway bridges and other public places. Traditionally, social service programs are the purview of the county, but we know that this issue is not just one government agency   s problem. It is an issue that affects all of us. That   s why the city has been working hard to bring government agencies, faith-based groups and nonprofit agencies together to holistically address the problem. We are calling this multifaceted initiative    Coming Home Anaheim.    Our police department, under the direction of our new police Chief Raul Quezada, has developed a Homeless Outreach Team. The dedicated officers on this special team interact with homeless people otheir challenges and needs and then help the individual find specific assistance, whether that is temporary housing, medical attention or job counseling. Agencies like Mercy Housing, the Illumination Foundation, and City-Net (an ad hoc network of churches from across Anaheim) and many generous local residents are working to assist our city in both formal and informal partnerships. Our approach to how we treat those in crisis - homeless individuals living in our community - is an example of how we as a city might look to become a healthier city in other areas as well. By focusing on what ails us and being intentional and transparent about it, we begin to incorporate new ideas and challenge ourselves to improve. When we demonstrate kindness in acts large and small, we will begin to see signs of good growth and strength. And as I remind myself when I get on the elliptical machine in the morning, like any mark of good health and fitness, we must work at kindness every day. - Tom Tait is the mayor of Anaheim. What are your resolutions for 2014 and why? Share your goals for the new year by emailing Anaheim bulletin ocregister com Include a photo of yourself if available. MAYOR TAIT IS TRULY A MAN OF THE PEOPLE After Mitt Romney lost the 2012 presidential election, the national GOF Leadership promised that they would begin a    rebranding and an outreach    to attract more women, Latinos, blacks and Asians. They finally realized that they can   t continue to be a party comprised solely o""seasoned citizens    and expect to win state, federal and non-gerrymandered local elections. Anaheim   s Republican leadership might want to think about that fact if they plan to continue to dominate our city   s politics. Mayor of Anaheim Tom Tait has done a stellar job trying to serve and protect all the citizens of our city. He has gone to bat for all of us without regard to our wealth, our ethnicity, our religion, our gender or what part of Anaheim we live in. He has worked tirelessly to do what is best for Anaheim and its citizens, not what is best for all the special-interest groups that have long had their way with our local politics. He has fought these powerful entities, and they are not pleased with Tom   s dynamic and refreshing leader ship. I understand several of our current or former city council members are planning to challenge Tait in the next city-wide election. They undoubtedly will have the full backing of the    powers that be    in the city. Arte Moreny and the Anaheim Chamber of Commerce all have deep pockets. It will be interesting to see just how much money they are willing to spend to regain political control of our city and evict the only mayor Anaheim has ever had who has actually fought for all the people - not just the rich and powerful. - Jay Garbutt, Anaheim Hills HARSH JOB CLIMATE NOT THE GOP'S FAULT I feel for your predicament, (letter-writer) Mr. Weikel.

KATELLA AVENUE IS GOING UPTOWN,ART MARROQUIN,Anaheim Bulletin,english,"Medians are now lined with palm trees with wider lanes stretching farther east on one of Anaheim   s major thoroughfares. Work crews are touching up landscaping and concrete work through the middle of January on a $6.9 million project to improve traffic How along Katella Avenue, from Lewis Street to State College Boulevard. Major construction wrapped up on New Year   s Eve, but recent rainstorms had delayed portions of the project. Crews from CMC Engineering, which started work in February, added a westbound lane along this half-mile stretch of Katella, repaved the roadway, widened traffic lanes and landscaped the median with towering palm trees that will be lighted at night. The improvements mirror Katella   s streetscape abutting the south end of Disneyland, providing continuity from Anaheim   s resort area. The traffic changes are meant to reduce congestion caused by vehicles traveling to and from Angel Stadium, the Honda Center, the City National Grove of Anaheim and the new Anahein Intermodal Center via 1-5 and the 57 freeway. Construction has started again on hundreds of new apartments within an area known as the Platinum Triangle, potentially bringing even more motorists to Katella. A streetcar could someday trundle along Katella, but the tracks would run curbside, so the new median would not be affected.

Lifetime angler shares passion through Harbour group,EVA KILGORE,Anaheim Bulletin,english,"Many children boarding the 80-foot chartered boat had never been fishing. Most hadn   t ever been on a boat. Kathy and Bruce Bayless, along with the Anglers of Huntington Harbour, made sure each child had an experience to remember. The Anglers began taking disadvantaged children on a kid   s fishing trip in 1971. The tradition has continued ever since.    The Freelance boat is chartered out of Davey   s Locker in Newport Beach,    said Kathy Bayless.    My husband Bruce and , along with the Anglers, get on board at 7 a.m. to set up rods and put hooks on lines as about 50 at-risk boys and girls from Huntington Beach schools arrive on buses chartered by the Anglers.    Bayless says the children range in age from 8 to 15.    The purpose of the trip is for the children to catch fish, so the captain goes to different fishing areas between Huntington Beach and Catalina, depending on where the fish are biting. The boat leaves about 8 a.m. and returns about 4 p.m.  r a dozen Anglers instructing the children, and they make sure each child is successful.    They help the children bait hooks and catch fish,    said Bayless. On this summer   s trip, the children caught barracuda, sand bass, sculpin and sand dabs,    There is a trophy for most unusual, and through the years, kids have struggled for 15 or 20 minutes trying to reel in a fish that turned out to be a rock, a piece of driftwood, and even seaweed.    The largest fish, says Bayless, was a barracuda more than 50 inches long.    At the start of the day, some of the children are a little apprehensive and hesitant to try fishing for the first time,    said Bayless.    After some Angler encouragement and instruction, they catch that first fish and then are baiting hooks and getting them in the water as fast as they can.    Bayless says she grew up in a family of fishers, started fishing when she was about 5 years old, and caught her first marlin by the time she was 1n we got married 38 years ago,    said Bayless. In addition to fishing activities with the Anglers of Huntington Harbour, the couple tries to get to Cabo San Lucas to do some marlin fishing every year.    We   ve also participated in seven fishing trips to East Cape with the Harbour Rod and Reel Club,    said Bayless. Kathy and Bruce Bayless own the Bayless Group residential and investment real estate company and moved to Huntington Harbour 13 years ago from Fullerton to live on the water and be closer to boating and fishing. They enjoy taking family, friends and clients on their Duffy boat, the Just in Time. And we love the kids    fishing trip each year,    said Bayless.    On this year   s summer trip, the children caught 173 fish. The crew clean and bag each child   s fish to take home.    Bayless says a photo is taken of each child catching a fish, and the photo is also taken home.    I take each photo and print it on board,    said ton Harbour commemorative T-shirt or hat, breakfast, lunch, beverages and snacks.    This trip is used as an incentive to motivate children who are falling behind to get back on track,    said Bayless.    Dr. Paul Morrow, principal of Marina High School, told me the Anglers    kids    fishing trip has become a life-changing event that adds joy and meaning to the lives of these atrisk children.    Trophies are awarded for jackpot fish, boys heaviest sack, girls heaviest sack, second largest, third largest, most unusual, sportsmanship, and more, explained Bayless.    This year, Bruce invited Raymond Fuentes, the CEO and founder of Rosa Packs on the trip, and he donated five eco-friendly Rosa Pack backpacks to the top boys and girls fishermen of the day,    said Bayless. Bayless says she and her husband joined the Anglers of Huntington Harbour to support the many philanthropies such as Harbour Ocean Preservation Enhancement, operating the white sea bass grow-out pen, preservation and enhancement of marine environment by contributing to the research, education and safeguarding of natural resources, allowing the continuation of sport fishing on our coast.    There are many additional activities, tournaments, TGIF events the last Friday of the month, cruises, and an annual fish fry,    said Bayless. And, of course the Angler   s kids    fishing trip.    My husband Bruce and I believe in enriching the lives of children, and want to support this philanthropy,    said Bayless.   ",2015,08-Jan
Orange marketing firm produces Saigon TV show,JONATHAN WINSLOW,Anaheim Bulletin,english,"   VietBuzz,    a new show on Saigon TV produced by an Orange marketing firm, seeks to close the entertainment gap for young Asian Americans who walk the line between multiplecultures. The brainchild of Orange- based Vantage CEO Yvon Nguyen,    VietBuzz    takes a talk show format similar to    The View,    with a group of female community leaders discussing entertainment, news, relationships, family and all manner of other things. The show airs every other week, with each episode switching between Vietnamese and English. In addition to this bilingual approach,    VietBuzz    also differs from traditional Vietnamese programs in critical ways, Nguyen said. While other Vietnamese programs tend to focus on Vietnamese-specific topics or simply translate mainstream news, hosts on I    VietBuzz    go beyond Vietnamese culture to offer opinions on pop culture, trends and such. Another key difference is the presence of editing - most traditional Vietnamese programs exclusively use a single camera with a | wide-angle shot, Nguyen | said. By contrast,    VietBuzz    makes use of close- ! Ups, multiple angles and    other techniques typically j expected of Western programming. All of these differences i are for the sake of drawing I in younger, bicultural viewers. Most Vietnamese programs are owned, operated and watched by older generations with a focus on first-generation Vietnamese Americans, she said.    VietBuzz    hopes to go beyond this trend to not only include but also celebrate the cultural diversity that exists within Asian Americans who have grown up between two worlds.    I think the young Incultura! population enjoys the best of both worlds,    Nguyen said.    They love Vietnamese/Asian culture such as food, family and traditions as well as Westernized luxuries such as rights, independence and entertainment.

Similarly, when going east on La Palma, the Gypsum light to go straight is also very short, followed by a long wait. Steve Goodman, Yorba Linda A.

Housing tract OK'd for former school site,ART MARROQUIN,Anaheim Bulletin,english,"A developer was cleared to build 75 houses spanning the 12-acre site formerly known as Riverdale Elementary in Anaheim Hills. The City Council voted 4-1 this month to change the zoning for the shuttered campus, allowing TRI Pointe Homes to move ahead with plans to build two-story houses ranging from 2,450 to 2,829 square feet. Mayor Tom Tait cast the dissenting vote during a public hearing held Jan. 12, siding with opponents who wanted to keep the Riverdale site as a school or convert it into a sports park. Others raised concerns about increased traffic in the neighborhood.    We longtime residents of the community have always had the expectation that Riverdale School would be used for education and sports fields,    said Richard Foltz, whose backyard is adjacent to the west side of the campus.    I hope none of you council members wash to be responsible for taking another Anaheim school and sports fields for a bunch of crowded homes,    Foltz said. Riverdale closed in June 2010 and isChristian Academy, a private elementary school that opened in September 201L Officials with the Rock Christian Academy declined to say how much they paid in rent for the facility. School district officials did not return messages asking about the rent payments. TRI Pointe Homes purchased the land for $17.9 million in October 2014 from the Orange Unified School District, which had declared Riverdale Elementary' as surplus property amid declining enrollment. By state law, all money from property sales has to be used for improvements to campuses and facilities within the school district, which serves about 30,000 students from kindergarten through high school in all or parts of Anaheim, Orange, Villa Park, Garden Grove and Santa Ana. Despite concerns about aging facilities, Orange Unified has never passed a bond measure. Most recently, voters narrowly rejected a $296 million bond in 2014 that would have fixed up the district   s four aging high schools.    I   m really hopeful that the Orange Urict can come to a consensus on how to move forward in ways that other districts in the city have to improve schools, but right now funding is a dire and critical need for facility enhancement for schools across the eastern end of our city,    Councilwoman Kris Murray ",2016,08-Dec

   SEA    YOU LATER,Erika I. Ritchie,Anaheim Bulletin,english,"Five 0 the elephant seal heads to the ocean at Crystal Cove, a bright spot in a year with increased elephant seal rescues. Ruby Pineda's visit to Crystal Cove State Beach was a day of firsts. The 11-year-old Santa Ana girl had never been to the ocean or seen a marine mammal. On Aug. 2, Ruby was among dozens who cheered as a 226-pound northern elephant seal named Five-O and an 88-pound sea lion named Barker were released to their natural habitat. The marine mammals, rescued by the Pacific Marine Mammal Center in Laguna Beach, were among 54 elephant seals and 111 sea lions rescued this year.    Where I live we don   t ever get to see this,    said Ruby, part of Camp Cove, a partnership between Crystal Cove State Park and the Santa Ana Police Department to expose young people to the ocean environment. Unlike the past four years where the Laguna center spent its resources rehabilitating starving California sea lions, attention this year was on elephant seals. Rescue numbers for these animals hav100 percent from last year, experts say. Five-0 was found starving on the sand at the Wedge in New port Beach on May 6. He weighed about 86 pounds, dramatically below the ideal 150-200 pounds. Barker was found at Brooks Street in Laguna Beach on June 10. She weighed about 51 pounds 30 pounds too low. The Marine Mammal Care Center Los Angeles took in 8 0 elephant seals this year compared to last year   s 48. Sea World San Diego treated 3 0. Last year it had 16.

Abdominal fat reducer provided to Hoiiywood stars by famous piastic surgeon now avaiiabie to pubiic,Dr. Frank Ryan,Anaheim Bulletin,english,"An advanced line of products used by famous Beverly Hills plastic surgeon Dr. Frank Ryan is now available to the public. Recently these products had been made available to Dr. Ryan's clients which included Oar winning Hollywood movie stars and celecties across the naticMi. These products help substantially improve personal appearance without plastic surgery. Dr. Ryan, perhaps the most famous Hollywood plastic surgeon in recent times, was extensively featured on television and in magazines across the nation. Dr. Ryan was also one of the first professional staff members of Endless Youth and Life which provides products and services that make celebrities look and perform many years younger than their age. On August 16, 2010 Dr. Ryan died in a tragic car accident on the Pacific Coast Highway near his ranch in Malibu. It was Dr. Ryan' s wishes that Endless Youth and Life would make his advanced non-surgical product line available to the public in the future. Endless Youth and Life is now complying with Dr. Ryan's wishes. The first product being offered to the public is I>r. Ryan's non-surgical personal appearance enhancement product. Dr. Frank Ryan's Abdominal Fat Reducer. Abdominal fat is the most stubborn fat to reduce and it is also the most hazardous fat to health. Abdominal fat produces destructive hormones that spread throughout the body. A pilot clinical study demonstrated that Dr. Frank Ryan's Abdominal Fat Reducer can support reducing your potbelly. A double blind clinical study was conducted on Dr. Frank Ryan's Abdominal Fat Reducer. The study on ""Abgone Extra Strength"" subsequently endorsed by Dr. Ryan was com- missioned by Advanced Supplement Research and used a research group which currently has an expert staff consisting of more than 32 board-certified Iysician investigators and more than 38 ACRP certified clinical research coordinators. This group conducts clinical studies for the (drug companies. While diet and exercise support weight loss, the formula in Dr. Ryan's Abdominal Fat Reducer demonstrates promising support for weight loss as well. The Dr. Ryan group had results in the right direction showing a promising reduction in weight. The weight loss was numericy larger than the changes in the group taking the placebo. At week 4, the test subjects in the study lost weight and enhanced their overall appearance (by reducing their pot belly) compared to the group that did not take Dr. Ryan's Abdominal Fat Reducer. Both groups were given the same dietary instructions and continued thier normal physical routine and did not do additional exercise. In addition at week 8, the study showed that Dr. Frank Ryan's Abdominal Fat Reducer increased resting metabolic rate (calorie burning) so that you lose weight faster. And, the study found that the all natural Dr. Frank Ryan's Abdominal Fat Reducer pill produced weight loss safely. How does Dr. Frank Ryan's Abdominal Fat Reducer work? It was found in a number of research studies on laboratory animals and later confirmed in human studies, that a substance called Conjugated Linoleic Acid (CLA) decreases abdominal body fat in three ways: 1.) CLA decreases abdominal body fat mass by decreasing the amount of abdominal fat that is stored after eating; 2.) CLA increases the rate of fat breakdown in abdominal fat cells; and 3.) CLA increases the rate of abdominal fat metabolism which decreases the total number of fat cells. You can think of CLA as a match that lights the fuse in abdominal fat. This fuse also increases metabolic rate that can result in more fat loss. Dr. Frank Ryan's Abdominal Fat Reducer contains the effective dose of CLA. CLA interferes with an enzyme called lipoprotein lipase (LPL). LPL is an enzyme that helps store fat in the body. So, by inhibiting this fat-storing enzyme LPL, CLA can help reduce the re-accumulation of fat. (XA also helps the body use its existing abdominal fat for energy, thereby increasing fat oxidition and energy expendit me Dr. Frank Ryan's Abdominal Fat Reducer also contains other super highly advanced all natural ingredients that help reduce abdominal fat. Of course, a healthy diet and exercise program, along with Dr. Ryan's Abdominal Fat Reducer, could result in even greater results. Studies have shown that Dr. Frank Ryan's Abdominal Fat Reduca ingredients increase the rate of fat metabolism, which reduces both surface and intestinal abdominal fat and helps inhibit future formation of these abdominal fats. ' One of the ingredients is a very high quality and potent extract of green tea. This extract is EGCG, which has been shown in clinical studies to quickly increase metabolism which helps to reduce abdominal body fat over time. These ingredients start working in 20 minutes and were clinically measured at 60 minutes and at 120 minutes to increase calorie burning, which is the first step to reducing the pot belly.

Levine, who co-owns the property with his wife and another partner, said they plan to construct Anaheim Express Carwash, a state-of-the-art facility.    We really believe in the redevelopment of this area,    Levine said Friday as earth movers pulled chunks of concrete from the old motel.    We were looking for a great location with high traffic, a large population density and no competition within three miles. This is it.    Opened in 1961, the 28-room Lyndy   s Motel anchored the corner with its two marquee signs and a 2,200-square-foot retail building that housed a Mexican restaurant and a flower shop. But over time, the motel, like many in the area, fell into disrepair. Neighbors began complaining. Over a four-yce responded to an average of 27 calls a year - 109 from 2012 to 2015 - ranging from prostitution, drugs, assault, trespassing and squatters. ",2017,10-Aug
District takes the plunge with plans for Anaheim High pool,Joseph Pimentel,Anaheim Bulletin,english,"Anaheim High School is known as the Jewel of the Colony and for a long time the campus pool helped it shine. For more than 70 years, the .pool was a vital part of the school and community. Throughout the school year, kids competed in water sports and bonded as teammates. In the summer, residents learned how- to swim. Larry Larsen, a 1964 graduate of Anaheim High School, remembers earning as an 8-year-old a Red Cross junior lifesaver certificate in that pool. When he became a Colonist, he   d watch swim meets and after football practice, he and his teammates would jump in to cool off.    It was a very active pool,    Larsen, 70 said.

Abdominal fat reducer provided to Hoiiywood stars by famous piastic surgeon now avaiiabie to pubiic,Dr. Frank Ryan,Anaheim Bulletin,english,"An advanced line of products used by famous Beverly Hills plastic surgeon Dr. Frank Ryan is now available to the public. Recently these products had been made available to Dr. Ryan's clients which included Oar winning Hollywood movie stars and celecties across the naticMi. These products help substantially improve personal appearance without plastic surgery. Dr. Ryan, perhaps the most famous Hollywood plastic surgeon in recent times, was extensively featured on television and in magazines across the nation. Dr. Ryan was also one of the first professional staff members of Endless Youth and Life which provides products and services that make celebrities look and perform many years younger than their age. On August 16, 2010 Dr. Ryan died in a tragic car accident on the Pacific Coast Highway near his ranch in Malibu. It was Dr. Ryan' s wishes that Endless Youth and Life would make his advanced non-surgical product line available to the public in the future. Endless Youth and Life is now complying with Dr. Ryan's wishes. The first product being offered to the public is I>r. Ryan's non-surgical personal appearance enhancement product. Dr. Frank Ryan's Abdominal Fat Reducer. Abdominal fat is the most stubborn fat to reduce and it is also the most hazardous fat to health. Abdominal fat produces destructive hormones that spread throughout the body. A pilot clinical study demonstrated that Dr. Frank Ryan's Abdominal Fat Reducer can support reducing your potbelly. A double blind clinical study was conducted on Dr. Frank Ryan's Abdominal Fat Reducer. The study on ""Abgone Extra Strength"" subsequently endorsed by Dr. Ryan was com- missioned by Advanced Supplement Research and used a research group which currently has an expert staff consisting of more than 32 board-certified Iysician investigators and more than 38 ACRP certified clinical research coordinators. This group conducts clinical studies for the (drug companies. While diet and exercise support weight loss, the formula in Dr. Ryan's Abdominal Fat Reducer demonstrates promising support for weight loss as well. The Dr. Ryan group had results in the right direction showing a promising reduction in weight. The weight loss was numericy larger than the changes in the group taking the placebo. At week 4, the test subjects in the study lost weight and enhanced their overall appearance (by reducing their pot belly) compared to the group that did not take Dr. Ryan's Abdominal Fat Reducer. Both groups were given the same dietary instructions and continued thier normal physical routine and did not do additional exercise. In addition at week 8, the study showed that Dr. Frank Ryan's Abdominal Fat Reducer increased resting metabolic rate (calorie burning) so that you lose weight faster. And, the study found that the all natural Dr. Frank Ryan's Abdominal Fat Reducer pill produced weight loss safely. How does Dr. Frank Ryan's Abdominal Fat Reducer work? It was found in a number of research studies on laboratory animals and later confirmed in human studies, that a substance called Conjugated Linoleic Acid (CLA) decreases abdominal body fat in three ways: 1.) CLA decreases abdominal body fat mass by decreasing the amount of abdominal fat that is stored after eating; 2.) CLA increases the rate of fat breakdown in abdominal fat cells; and 3.) CLA increases the rate of abdominal fat metabolism which decreases the total number of fat cells. You can think of CLA as a match that lights the fuse in abdominal fat. This fuse also increases metabolic rate that can result in more fat loss. Dr. Frank Ryan's Abdominal Fat Reducer contains the effective dose of CLA. CLA interferes with an enzyme called lipoprotein lipase (LPL). LPL is an enzyme that helps store fat in the body. So, by inhibiting this fat-storing enzyme LPL, CLA can help reduce the re-accumulation of fat. (XA also helps the body use its existing abdominal fat for energy, thereby increasing fat oxidition and energy expendit me Dr. Frank Ryan's Abdominal Fat Reducer also contains other super highly advanced all natural ingredients that help reduce abdominal fat. Of course, a healthy diet and exercise program, along with Dr. Ryan's Abdominal Fat Reducer, could result in even greater results. Studies have shown that Dr. Frank Ryan's Abdominal Fat Reduca ingredients increase the rate of fat metabolism, which reduces both surface and intestinal abdominal fat and helps inhibit future formation of these abdominal fats. ' One of the ingredients is a very high quality and potent extract of green tea. This extract is EGCG, which has been shown in clinical studies to quickly increase metabolism which helps to reduce abdominal body fat over time. These ingredients start working in 20 minutes and were clinically measured at 60 minutes and at 120 minutes to increase calorie burning, which is the first step to reducing the pot belly.

County supervisors will consider site in Anaheim,Alicia Robinson,Anaheim Bulletin,english,"Orange County supervisors will consider several possible avenues to put a veterans cemetery on a piece of county-owned land near where the 91 and 241 freeways meet in east Anaheim. County Supervisor Todd Spitzer said last week that officials asked to get information at an August meeting about the process to turn 288 acres of open space into a resting place for those who have served in the military and their families. It could entail working with the federal Department of Veterans Affairs; the corresponding state agency, known as CalVet; and the Orange County Cemetery District. The move follows Irvine voters    June 5 decision to reject a land swap that would have helped build a veterans cemetery in their city near the 405/5 freeway interchange. The election   s outcome threw the cemetery plans into limbo, but Spitzer stressed the supervisors    decision to explore the Anaheim site doesn   t preclude Irvine from continuing to pursue a project locally.    We didn   t vote to  said.    We   re just in the very earliest stages of trying to figure out what the assessment process would be.    Irvine Councilman Jeff Lalloway has said he will ask his colleagues Wednesday to reconsider the first of two cemetery sites proposed in the city.

Doti has a passion beyond Chapman,Rebecca Allen,Anaheim Bulletin,english,"You may think you know James Doti. But the secret Doti needs a shed. Of course, he was president of Chapman University for 25 years, elevating the sleepy Christian college to a university with more than 8,000 students while raising tens of millions of dollars. You may know that Doti stepped down as president and went back to teaching economics at Chapman. He   s also semifamously a marathon runner and mountain climber. The thing you might not know is that he loves to make wooden bowls and even invented the    Doti Bowl.    He uses a lathe and a bandsaw and a medieval-looking implement called a gouge. With these tools and a lot of patience, he finds the beauty inside a homely chunk of wood. For a couple of hours a week, between walking Angel, the rescue German shepherd, and cooking pasta dinner for wife Lynne, Doti makes wooden bowls. This hobby requires a shed. It bears little resemblance to the sheds where most people keep their yard tools, but it is indeed a shed. When Doti started turningspace from a local carpenter who had a wood shop.

"More Orange County cities, school boards shift to voting districts on November ballot",Alicia Robinson,Anaheim Bulletin,english,"When Orange County voters cast ballots this November, more of them than ever will choose representatives from the geographic district where they live, rather than from one citywide or school district-wide pool of candidates. The candidate filing period for the Nov. 6 election opened Monday and closes Aug. 10. Council seats in all 34 cities and trustee seats on all 27 school district boards in Orange County will be on the ballot. Area cities began shifting how they elect their leaders in 2014, when Anaheim became the first Orange County city to settle a voting rights lawsuit. The city agreed to change from an at-large City Council to six districts with a representative from each. Since then, a handful of cities and school districts have made the switch, and 15 more will offer their first district elections this fall. More local governments are likely to adopt a district system in coming years because California law makes it easy to challenge the equity of atlarge elections, UC Irvine political science professor Louis DeSipio said.

Agopian,Anaheim Bulletin,english,"The City Council on Tuesday delayed for one week the debate on setting term limits for board and commission members, as community members turned out to criticize the proposal. Mayor Curt Pringle said that Councilman Richard Chavez, who was absent because of an illness, asked that discussion be continued so that he could be present. The council previously voted 3-2 to ask City Attorney Jack White to draft an ordinance on the issue. Pringle and Chavez were joined by Councilman Tom Tait, who asked that such an ordinance be explored. Council members Shirley McCracken and Bob Hernandez voted against the proposal, saying that the council would do just as well if it removed those board and commission members it felt were no longer sewing the city well. Former councilwoman Miriam Kaywood asked the council to go back and take a second look at the proposal. ""This is such an insult to the people who have been serving and serving well,"" she said. ""If they're not doing their job all you have to do is say I move to remove this person ... and I know because I've done it. If someone is not serving the city well, then you should remove them."" move members they don't feel are best serving the city. ""We don't need new ideas. We've got ideas coming out the gazoo,"" he said. ""What we need is intelligent people who must know the subject that they're addressing."" Chamber of Commerce President Mike Neben also addressed the issue, saying that as a representative of the city's business community the chamber wants experienced commission members to be able to continue their service. ""We favor talcing the political motives out of the selection and appointment process, holding the appointees accountable ... and removing those that are incapable of performing in a professional and unbiased manner,"" he said. The proposed ordinance would require any current board or commission members who are serving past two full four-year terms would be required to vacate their seats within 90 days. The city's guidelines for board and commission term limits would follow those set for council members - limiting members to two consecutive terms and forcing a two-year period off any boards before they can be reappointed. The limit would also prohibit members from more than one commission at a time, with the exception of ex-officio members who have to represent boards or commissions to other commissions. The ordinance would also count as one full service any two partial terms that equaled at least half a full term. In a separate ordinance, the council is also considering restructuring the Golf Course Advisory Commission, whose members have averaged more than 20 years each. The ordinance, if approved, would reduce the number of members from nine to five - though four only serve now. A parenthetical to the golf ordinance indicated that the city is moving toward dissolving the Anaheim Arts Council, replacing it with a Cultural Commission. The Arts Council, which was created by an ordinance in 1977, was always meant to be temporary. With the city's approval of a new cultural plan also came the suggestion to detach the Arts Council from the city and help it become its own nonprofit organization. The parameters of a Cultural Commission, which would be tasked with the goals laid out in the cultural plans, have not yet been hammered out, according to Community Services director Chris Jarvi. Council OKs permit parking on Clearbrook Residents of Clearbrook Lane secured guaranteed parking for their neighborhood Tuesday night when the City Council voted 4-0 to allow permit-only parking on the residential street from Webster Avenue to the end of the culdesac. Councilman Richard Chavez was absent from the meeting. All the residents of the street signed and delivered a petition to the city in November, seeking to form a resident-only parking area. The Planning Department supported their request and the Police Department agreed to patrol the street for violations. Here are other results from the Anaheim City Council meeting Tuesday night: STATE COLLEGE BOULEVARD Approved a $185,753 contract with R.J. Noble Co. for the State College Boulevard project, to conduct road way improvements between Orangethorpe Avenue and Via Burton Street. Approximately $100,000 in federal funds are set aside for the project. Approved, 4-0. Mayor Curt Pringle, Yes; Bob Hernandez, Yes; Richard Chavez, Absent; Shirley McCracken, Yes; Tom Tait, Yes. STATE COLLEGE AGREEMENT Approved the agency-state agreement to conduct improvements along State College Boulevard. The city applied for the funds to complete the project through the Orange County Transportation Authority, which obtained the funds through a state-administered program. BUS SHELTERS Approved extending an agreement with Viacom Outdoor, Inc. to continue maintenance services for bus shelters in the city on a month-to-month basis for eight months. The agreement also authorizes the staff to continue month-to-month agreements after the foregoing eight months. In 1994, the city entered into an eight-year agreement with Viacom. At the end of that contract, in October, the city solicited bids for a new service provider, but found none, sticking with Viacom. The agreement will generate about $13,000 each month for the city. VETERANS FUNDS Accept an award of $96,000 from the county's Board of Supervisors for the Workforce Investment Act Cost Reimbursements Agreement with the county for the Veteran's Employment Program Services. The state recently approved a request from the Anaheim and county workforce investment boards to develop a program, managed by the city's Workforce Development Division, serving 30 veterans through the Anaheim Workforce Center. THERAPEUTIC RECREATION CENTER Approved a one-year lease agreement with the YMCA of Orange County, authorizing it to use the Anaheim Therapeutic Recreation Center for a Saturday night class for developmentally disabled adults..

Public comment sought on proposed Westcot park,David Heitz,Anaheim Bulletin,english,"Ever since the environmental impact report for the proposed $3 billion Disneyland expansion was released five months ago, sharp conversation about the project     and the boons and burdens associated with it     has gripped this city. Next week, residents can express their opinions to the planning commissioners who will review the project. The public hearing has been set for 1:30 p.m. Wednesday in the Park Plaza Ballroom of the Inn at the Park Hotel, 1855 S. Harbor Blvd. The Walt Disney Co. wants to add a world's fair-type theme park, two multi-deck parking garages (capable of housing more than 34,300 cars), and three large hotels to Disneyland. The changes would more than quadruple the park's size to 470 acres, gobbling up scores of small motels and other properties. Plans also call for extensive landscaping and improvements to Katella Avenue, Harbor Boulevard and West Street, which will be re named Disneyland Drive next to the park. The new theme p""Westcot,"" would have up to 3.35 million square feet of attractions, pavilions, an amphitheater, restaurants and retail stores. A 2,300-page report, which is contained in five volumes the size of big-city phone books, outlines the details of the expansion. Construction could be complete as earlv as 1998. At the hearing, the seven-member Planning Commission will listen to Disneyland neighbors who say they're worried about Westcot potentially creating noise, crime, congestion and pollution. Disney officials and supporters of the project say the majority of environmental impacts can be mitigated to insignificance. They pitch Westcot as a savior for Orange County's ailing economy, pointing to an annual economic impact in Anaheim of $1.2 billion. After planning commissioners digest earfulls of comments, they'll be charged with the task of shaping the plans of one of the largest developments in Southern California's history. ""This is a momentous project and it's obviously important not just for the city of Anaheim, but for the region,"" Planning Commissioner Julie Mayer said. ""I think we need to hear what everyone has to say. Hopefully, it won't be repetitious and groups will have a spokesperson represent them."" She said she has spent several hours listening to differing opinions about the project, and recently sifted through a three-foot stack of related documents. Commissioner Phyllis Boydstun said Disney representatives will present an hour-long ""show"" that will explain the impact and scope of the project from their perspective. ""I don't mean a show, really, but a presentation. They will have slides and walk through it so people can see exactly what they want to do."" Disneyland officials have said Westcot is one of the biggest planned projects in the world right now. ""There's lots of interest, so I'm sure there will be lots of people there. It will be the first time the public actually will see (the project plans),"" Boydstun said. ""Looking at an EIR, for people who have never seen one, it's very difficult to picture in your mind what they're doing."" She previously has expressed concerns about the enormity of the parking garages. ""I was afraid it would put traffic into the neighborhoods from the west, but they have changed all of that. Everything will come off West Street or the freeway."" The plans have been revised to turn the garages, which would be built on West Street, away from residential neighborhoods. ""They're also going to tier back another floor and have more landscaping, so it won't be such a 'wall' experience,"" Boydstun said. Representatives of Anaheim HOME and other homeowners groups have said the garage will create noise and bring car burglars into their area. Commissioner Mitch Caldwell said he plans to listen very closely to neighbors' concerns. ""I'm very pro-resident and I'm going to side with the residents     a"" he said. ""They're the charter members of the Anaheim club."" Caldwell believes there won't be many gray areas when in the project's plans. ""I think the project appears to be something everyone wants, but we will see."" He said he and the other commissioners will be asking lots of questions. ""It's right in our backyard and we want to make sure it happens with the utmost care and concern of everyone involved.""",2018,05-Apr

Owner dials back rent hike after protests,Jeong Park,Anaheim Bulletin,english,"The new owner of a senior mobile home park straddling the border of Fullerton and Anaheim is pulling back on monthly rent increases of more than $200 for nearly 400 residents until at least Sept. 1, saying the company had done    too much, too soon.       The increasing concerns that were being voiced by the residents required a pause and an opportunity to initiate a dialogue with those residents to better understand their concerns,    said Peter Whittingham, a spokesman for Saunders Property Company, which purchased the Rancho La Paz Mobile Home Park in February. The reversal announced March 27 came after Anaheim Mayor Harry Sidhu organized a meeting early last week between residents and the owner. The company is planning further meetings with residents to see how it can increase rents in a way that   s least impactful, Whittingham said. For weeks, the residents     about 150 in Fullerton and 240 in Anaheim     have gone to city council meetings in both cities, calliI   m happy they are at least negotiating with us,    said Lupe Ramirez, 67, a five-year resident of the park.    We have to continue to push forward some kind of protection with the city because nobody needs to go through what we   ve gone through.

More violence shelters are welcoming pets to encourage owners to come seek safety,Jeong Park,Anaheim Bulletin,english,"Many of those trying to escape domestic violence asked the Women   s Transitional Living Center the same question: Could their pet come with them? For years, the Orange County shelter said no. But the question kept coming.    We were seeing more and more callers who would say they can   t come to the shelter because they need to be with their pets,    said the shelter   s director, Mark Lee.    Why did we make it so hard for them to come to us?    Last year, the center became one of at least eight domestic violence shelters in Southern California that houses pets on-site     taking in 22 with their owners in 2018. The number of shelters allowing victims to bring their pets along has more than doubled in the region in the past few years, said animal advocacy group Red Rover. The increase mirrors a trend seen among homeless shelter operators, which have increasingly started allowing pets so people needing a place to stay wouldn   t refuse the help. Several hhey are realizing the support that animals bring to their struggling owners.    For a lot of people, their pet is just like their child,    Lee said.    If they don   t have their pets, they have a lot of anxiety.    And the pets may need a safe place, too, Red Rover CEO Nicole Forsyth said.    Pets are part of the abuse,    she said.    If they don   t bring their pets, they are used as a anipulative tool to get them to come back or to not have them leave in the first place.    And having pets around can be good for the shelter, from improving staff morale to creating a more relaxed atmosphere, Forsyth said.    They have seen so many positive outcomes that far outweigh the challenges.    ",2019,04-Apr
3-mile stretch of 5 Freeway will gain second car pool lane in each direction,Susan Christian,Anaheim Bulletin,english,"A second carpool lane is coming to the 5 Freeway     making two in each direction between the 55 and 57 freeways.    The project will help speed up commutes and alleviate bottlenecks on 1-5 in Santa Ana, Orange and Tustin ,    said Orange County Transportation Authority spokeswoman Megan Abba. Traffic on the 3-mile stretch is expected to climb from 380,000 to more than 400,000 vehicles a day by 2035, Abba said. To make room for the added car pool lanes, the 5 Freeway car pool ramps on Main Street in Santa Ana will be demolished this summer. The ramps originally were established so drivers could seamlessly enter and exit the car pool lanes. In preparation for their removal, those ramps were expected to permanently close as early as this week. Main Street will remain open during construction. Concrete barriers between the car pool and regular lanes also will be eliminated for the additional carpoollanes. However, the freeway itself will not undergo widening. Consequently, soundwalls and land afreeway will not be affected, Abba said. Construction is slated for completion in early 2021.The 1-5 Central CountyIm provements Project, a joint effort by OCTA and Caltrans, is projected to cost $41.5 million. It will be paid for with federal funding and money from easure M, Orange County   s half-cent sales tax for transportation upgrades. Already, nighttim elane closures are underway on the 5 Freeway and 57 Freeway connector, where installatio n of temporary concrete barriers will create work areas. In keeping with OCTA   s modern approach, the carpool lanes will be striped for continuous access     allowing drivers to movefreely between the car pool and regular lanes. In 2007, OCTA started switching to broken-line car pool lanes, deeming them safer.    T here   s no reason to rush across several lanes of traffic to enter the car pool lanes,    OCTA says on its website.    And there   s no need to slow down to exit.

"Planned cemetery will have space for Vietnamese, Korean allies",Alicia Robinson,Anaheim Bulletin,english,"A cemetery Orange County officials want to build using sprawling land on Anaheim   s eastern end could make history, with space included for those who fought alongside American forces in Vietnam and Korea. The soldiers who supported the U.S. military were struggling for freedom and emocracy, and they should be afforded respect, said county Supervisor Andrew Do, who led supervisors Tuesday in designating 10 percent of the future cemetery toward a final resting place for members of the military or government of allied forces.

Accidentally in the big leagues,David Jerome,Anaheim Bulletin,english,"Errors are a big part of baseball, and they don   t just occur on the field. This year marks the golden anniversary of a gum card goof involving a hometown boy. Aurelio Rodriguez   s 1969 Topps baseball card actually shows the image of Angels batboy Leonard Garcia. It   s one of the hobby   s beloved error cards, and it arguably made Garcia the game   s most famous batboy (with the possible exception of Darren Baker, who was saved from being run over at home plate by J.T. Snow in the 2002 World Series). Garcia was a military brat raised in Panama, Texas and California. His family eventually settled in Anaheim     just 3 miles from the new stadium still under construction. One day, the Anaheim High School student heard that the California Angels were having interviews for the team    s batboy positions. He and 200 other hopefuls showed up at the Anaheim Stadium construction site to be interviewed in a utility trailer near what is today the main entrance. Garcia beat thls    batboys for the whopping salary of $5 a game. He servedas batboy in 1966 and as the team    s assistant    clubby    in 1967-68.In 1967, Garcia was 18. Because he could speak Spanish, he was befriended by some of the Angels    Latino players, including Jose Cardinal, Ruben Amaro and Aurelio Rodriguez, the Angels    third baseman, a19-year-old September call-up. Garcia occasionally would travel with the team. And when the Angels closed out the 1967 season in Detroit with two doubleheaders in two days, he was there. The games had play offimplications as the Red Sox, Twins and Tigers all were vying for the pennant. Usually, Garcia didn   t wear a number on the back of his uniform, but that day in Detroit he was given a uniform with a number on it.    34 or 37,    he said.    I don   t really remember.    Garcia was down the right field line at Tiger Stadium playing catch with Rodriguez when they were both approached by legendary baseba their names down in a note pad.    I could see that he got our names mixed up, but when I told him, all he did was draw a little half-circle reversal arrows by our names,    Garcia remembered. In the winter of 1967-68, the newly formed Major League Baseball Players Association wanted Topps to deal with it instead of on a player-by-player basis, as it had in the past.

Orange may get parking structure,Jeong Park,Anaheim Bulletin,english,"Another parking structure is being discussed for Old Towne Orange     though it would be years before it opens. The City Council last week approved paying $56,000 to Watry Design for a site plan with possibly 200 to 300 stalls in a structure at Almond Avenue and G rand Street, possibly replacing the Orange Fire Department headquarters and an apartment complex. The city already has been looking at building new headquarters at 105 S. Water St., although it   s still uncertain how the city would fund that project. Old Towne Orange has chronically struggled with parking. A 608-stall structure near the Metrolink Stationon the area   s west side opened in February. But the city for years also has discussed an eastside structure as well, city spokesman Paul Sitk off said. Watry Design will look at two options: A stand-alone structure or a mixed-use project that also could include office spaces for city staffers. The proposed parking structure could cost $7 million to $13 million, according to estimgn   s proposal. But Sitk off stressed neither funding nor a final construction cost for the structure has been identified.

"Planned cemetery will have space for Vietnamese, Korean allies",Alicia Robinson,Anaheim Bulletin,english,"A cemetery Orange County officials want to build using sprawling land on Anaheim   s eastern end could make history, with space included for those who fought alongside American forces in Vietnam and Korea. The soldiers who supported the U.S. military were struggling for freedom and democracy, and they should be afforded respect, said county Supervisor Andrew Do, who led supervisors Tuesday in designating 10 percent of the future cemetery toward a final resting place for members of the military or government of allied forces.    It was more of a universal conflict against communism,    Do said.    We fought together, not just as Americans and Vietnamese but as fellow compatriots.    The county is transferring 283 acres near the junction of the 91 and 241 freeways to the Orange County Cemetery District; it will be the fourth cemetery in the district and will alleviate a pressing shortage of public burial space. A section of the cemetery already was planned for American military vetof any military cemetery in the country that honors allied troops, so Orange County   s could be the first.    This cemetery will greatly commemorate the Korea-U.S. relationship and will be a comfort to our Korean veterans,    said James Lee, president of the Korean Veterans Association   s Southwest Region. He was speaking in Korean.    We are proud to lay to rest in the United States as a Korean veteran.    Orange County is home to more than 750 Korean veterans who fought in the Korean or Vietnam wars, Lee said. Some have considered returning to South Korea to be buried in the country    s national cemeteries, but many want to stay here close to their families.    Th",2019,04-Apr

Parking structure coming soon to Old Towne Orange,Jeong Park,Anaheim Bulletin,english,"A parking structure for Metrolink riders and visitors to Old Towne Orange will open Feb. 19, which city officials hope will relieve the area   s chronic parking problem. More than 100 parking spots in the $29.5 million, 608-space structure will be reserved daily for the public to use free with three-hour limitations. During weekdays, the rest of the spaces will be for those traveling by Metrolink, but visitors will be able to park in those spots during nights and weekends. The building replaces a surface lot that had 172 parking spaces. The city has discussed the project for more than a decade, but it was delayed when the state dissolved redevelopment agencies in 2012, affecting a possible funding source. Meanwhile, Old Towne has continued to grow in popularity with new restaurants and shopping. The city and the Orange County Transportation Authority secured enough federal and state funds, as well as committing their own money, to finally get the construction started in 2017. ' The city spent more than lion to secure hundreds of the structure   s spots for visitor parking, Public Works Director Chris Cash said.He said that he hopes the structure will bring more businesses to Old Towne   s west side now that more nearby parking will be available. The structure has three aboveground levels and two levels below. It will include charging ports for electric cars, and bike racks and lockers.

2019 WILL BE A BUSY YEAR FOR BIG ROAD CONSTRUCTION PROJECTS,Jeong Park,Anaheim Bulletin,english,"It will be a busy 2019 for major freeways in Orange County.The 405 Freeway will continue to undergo a $1.9 billion expansion between the 73 and the 605     adding regular and carpool lanes and widening or reconstructing more than 18 bridges. Work will continue all year; completion is expected in 2023-    It has been decades since there has been an expansion like this,    Orange County Transportation Authority spokesman Joel Zlotnik said.    This is the largest (project) that OCTA has undertaken.    Nearly $600 million will be spenton two major projects that will start on the 5 Freeway in 2019: Adding a carpool lane between the 55 and 57, and adding a regular traffic lane between Avery Parkway and Alicia Parkway. That   s in addition to the $1.8 billion widening project from the Los Angeles County border to the 605 that will continue throughout 2019. That project is expect to finish in 2021. Zlotnik said the transportation authority has been working with the cities to limit inesses and residents along the 16 miles of the 405 under construction. There will be no daytime lane closures and there is a plan for staging bridge closures, he said.    There will be multiple bridges reconstructed at the same time, but there won   t be consecutive bridges.    It   s not an easy process,    Zlotnik said.    Construction is tough, but the alternative is that we   ll be stuck in gridlock.

GardenWalk poised to expand its amenities,Alicia Robinson,Anaheim Bulletin,english,"The newest owner of Anaheim   s GardenWalk, its third in a decade, is hoping a slew of changes and new additions will lead to a level of success that has so far eluded the open-air mall less than a mile from Disneyland. Whittier-based STC Management has signed leases with restaurants that will serve Indian street food, Japanese fusion cuisine, Taiwanese desserts, boba tea and more, company CEO John Hsu said. Also expected to fill out the mail   s vacant storefronts: a board game cafe, a bar with arcade games and a year-round haunted house. Hsu is aiming to have many of the incoming businesses open by summer, soon after an AMC theater that closed last year at Downtown Disney opens at GardenWalk on Memorial Day weekend. The already signed leases should bring the mail   s occupancy to about 90 percent.    We   re hoping by the end of the year we should be 100 percent,    Hsu said.    We   re very aggressive.    STC     which manages commercial propertiebuilding that housed Richard Nixon   s first law office     bought the struggling GardenWalk in December for $80 million, which Hsu considered a bargain. Originally built for about $130 million, the center reportedly sold for $73 million in 2012 after a bankruptcy. While GardenWalk may not have lived up to its potential yet, Anaheim city spokesman Mike Lyster said, it has done better in the past few years because of the relocation of the House of Blues from Downtown Disney and openings of several other stores and eateries.    There   s so much potential there and we just want to see the center continue along that path    he said of the new ownership. Hsu said when GardenWalk was built, area rents soared and smaller, independent businesses couldn   t afford to stay. The corporate chains that came in were attractive mainly to tourists, not drawing the locals looking for something unique. He sees demand there that he hopes to fill with variety, including an array of food and d all ages. Anaheim Councilwoman Lucille Kring, who ran a wine bar at GardenWalk for three years, said what has really hampered the center is that it was    terribly designed,    leaving tenants who aren   t next to the street hidden from view, and the parking structure     with limited free parking     an annoyance.

Orange is sued over council electior -,JeongPark,Anaheim Bulletin,english,"A lawsuit recently filed in state court seeks to force the city of Orange to change how its City Council members are chosen by voters. The city uses the at-large system, where all voters choose from the slate of candidates for the council. That system dilutes the votes of Latinos, which make up nearly 40 percent of the city   s population, said Kevin Shenkman, the attorney who filed the lawsuit. His firm had sent a letter in April 2017 demanding the city adopt district-based elections. Under that system, the city would be carved into geographic districts and the smaller pool of voters in each district would choose a representative to the council. Numerous cities and school districts across Orange County and California have made the shift to district elections in the past few years, many in response to lawsuit threats.    We attempted to get the city to change its election system without the need for litigation,    Shenkman said.    But haven   t had any luck.    He said the special election in November rather than appoint a Latina candidate, Betty Valencia, was a factor in bringing the lawsuit. Valencia finished third in the November election for two council seats. But another seat opened up because of that election when Mark Murphy rose from being a councilman to mayor. The council had the choice of appointing a replacement or having an election.    I understand her views don   t with the majority of the council,  ",2019,04-Apr
Barton Parks new playground is made to be accessible,Heather McRea,Anaheim Bulletin,english,"Anaheim   s latest playground offers fun to children who might not be able to get as much use out of the city   s other parks. Built recently by volunteers, the playground at Barton Park has play equipment that is accessible to children with disabilities. Children who use wheelchairs can spin around on a merry-go-round type feature that can use straps to hold them in place. The Teeter TXinnel has equipment that will help a child transfer safely out of a chair and onto the teeter-totter. There are also accessible swings, and for children with vision impairments there are Braille panels throughout the playground, officials said. Most city parks have something that is accessible to children with disabilities, city spokeswoman Erin Ryan said, but Barton Park is the first to have integrated ramp access and a playground fully designed for use. The playground was sponsored by the Disneyland Resort through the national Kaboom! Program, which organizes community build projects across the country. Anaheim Fnd the city helped out. Disneyland   s CastABLE diversity resource group pitched the idea of an accessible playground and offered expertise, officials said. Children from the surrounding neighborhood also helped with suggestions for the design.

Iger said    tremendous demand    from guests led to the decision to open earlier than expected.    On opening day, we will transport guests to a galaxy far, far away,    Iger told the shareholders. However, people will need a free advance reservation to access the land between May 31 and June 23, which Disneyland Resort hotel guests will receive automatically with their hotel stay.

   A devastated city   ,Darlene Superville,Anaheim Bulletin,english,"BEIRUT    A massive explosion rocked Beirut on Tuesday, flattening much of the city   s port, damaging buildings across the capital and sending a giant mushroom cloud into the sky. More than 70 people were killed and 3,000 injured, with bodiesburied in the rubble, officials said. It was not clear what caused the blast, which struck with the force of a3.5 magnitude earthquake, according to Germany   s geosciences center GFZ, and was heard and felt as far away as Cyprus more than 180 miles across the Mediterranean. Lebanon   s interior minister said it appeared that a large cache of ammonium nitrate in the port had detonated. The sudden devastation overwhelmed a country already struggling with both the coronavirus pandemic and a severe economic and financialcrisis. For hours after the explosion, ambulances rushed in from around the country to carry away the wounded. Hospitals quickly filled beyond capacity, pleading for blood supplies, and generators to keep theirlights on. For blocks arresidents staggered through streets lined with overturned cars and littered with rubble from shattered buildings. Windows and doors were blown out miles away, including at the city   s only international airport. Army helicopters helpedbattle fires. Interior Minister Moham- med Fahmi told alocal TV station that it appeared the blast was caused by the detonation of more than 2,700 tons of ammonium nitrate that had been stored in a warehouse at the dock ever since it was confiscated from a cargo ship in 2014. Witnesses reported seeing an orange cloud like that which appears when toxic nitrogen dioxide gas is released after an explosion involving nitrates. Videos showed what appeared to be a fire erupting nearby just before, and local TV stations reported that a fireworks warehouse was involved. The fire appeared to spread to a nearby building, triggering the more massive explosion, sending up a mushroom cloud and generating a shock wave. Charbel Haj, who works at the port, said the blast started as small ions like firecrackers. Then, he said, he was thrown off hisfeet. The explosion came amid ongoing tensions between Israel and the Hezbollah military group on Lebanon   s southern border. Many residents reported hearing planes overhead just before the blast, fueling rumors of an attack, though Israeli military overflight sare common. An Israeli government official said Israel    had nothing to do    with the blast. Hespoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to discuss the matter with the news media. President Donald Trump said the U.S.    stands ready to assist Lebanon,    and U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo extended his    deepest condolences.       Our team in Beirut has reported to me the extensive damage to a city and a people that I hold dear, an additional challenge in a time of already deep crisis,    Pompeo said in a written statement. At the start of a White House news conference on the coronavirus, Trump said the explosioneporter if he was confident that it was an attack, Trump said:    I met with some of our great generals and they just seem to feel that it was.    But one of Israel   s top bomb experts, Boaz Hayoun, said fireworks could have been a factor setting off the bigger blast.    Before the big explosion ... in the center of the fire, you can see sparks, you can hear sounds like popcorn and you can hear whistles,    said Hayoun, owner of the Tamar Group, which works closely with the Israeli government on safety and certification issues involving explosives.    This is very specific behavior of fireworks.    The blast was stunning even for a city that has seen a 15-year civil war, suicide bombings, bombardment by Israel and political assassinations.    It was a real horror show. I haven   t seen anything like that since the days of the (civil) war,    said Marwan Ramadan, who was about 500 yards from the port and was knocked off his feet by the force of the ers as he toured the site, exclaiming,    Beirut is a devastated city.    Prime Minister Hassan Diab vowed that    those responsible will pay.    Confusion reigned across the city, as people cleared out of damaged homes or tried to locate family. Motorcyclists picked their way through traffic, carrying the injured. One woman covered in blood from the waist up walked down a trashed street while talking furiously on her phone. On another street, a woman with a bloodied face looked distraught, staggering through traffic with two friends at her side.     This country is cursed,  ",2020,05-Aug

What   s the plan if park district swaps ,ERIC PETERSOY,Anaheim Bulletin,english,"Prospect Heights Park District commissioners are considering potential designs for a reconfiguration of John Muir Park but have yet to discuss in detail a proposed land swap that would enable it. Lexington Homes has made an offer to trade 0.62 acres from the former Jolly Fun House Academy site for anequal amount of parkland, along with a $500,000 payment to the park district. That would allow construction of a controversial 69-unit townhouse development north of the parkat 999 OakAve. The townhouse proposal received preliminary approval in a 3-2 vote from Prospect Heights aldermen this month, despite opposition from surrounding property owners. Without the land swap, Lexington Homes would resort to a backup plan for only 61 town houses on a 5.23-acre site. The company has not formally sought city approval for that proposal. At city meetings on the development, neighbors have strongly criticized the proposed development. And at last week   s park district meeting, three residents voiced their opposition and swap, Executive Director ChristinaFerraro said. JohnMuir Park has a total of 4.5 acres.

The strikes by Iran were amajor escalation of tensions that have been rising steadily across the Mideast following months of threats and attacks after President Donald Trump   s decision to unilaterally withdraw America from Tehran   s nuclear deal with world powers. Iranian state TV said the attack was in revenge for the U.S. killing of Revolutionary Guard Gen. Qassem Soleimani, whose funeral procession Tuesday in his hometown of Kerman prompted angry calls to avenge his death. Soleimani   s killing and Iran   s missile strikes also marked the first time in recent years that Washington and Tehran have attacked each other directly rather than through proxies in the region.

The training would focus on creating safe environments and shifting the culture of the building, while addressing stressful and crisis-evoking situations for students, teachers and the overall classroom,    Mills said.    The Circle Process offers a different way of dealing with the challenges of everyday life as well as responding to the larger challenges we face. Many of our students have sufr it be physical violence, abandonment, homelessness or hunger.   Mills said this internal trauma, if not addressed,    often manifests in external violence.

City: US 301 project 95% complete, Brie Handgraaf,Anaheim Bulletin,english,"Crews are expected to finish the U.S. 301 redevelopment project this spring, roughly two years after the road detours started.    I think it has been a great project,    said Bill Bass, Wilson public works director, estimating about 95% of the project is complete.    The weather delays have extended the lane closures, but everybody seems to be very patient, and I think it will be worthwhile. It will all pay off when we finish.    In 2015, Wilson was awarded $10 million through a Transportation Investment Generating Economic Recovery grant, which was paired with $6 million from the N.C. Department of Transportation and about $2 million from the city. Construction has included improved storm water systems from Black Creek Road to Lipscomb Road as well as raised medians, sidewalks and crosswalks.    What they are doing currently is filling in the gaps in the sidewalks and repairing broken curb and gutter and sidewalks,   Bass said.    Probably in March or April, when theing machine to get the grade of the road correct, and they   ll put the final layer of surface down.    If all the repairs are made prior to the final milling and resurface work, they may find opportunities to remove closures.    Originally the project was slated to be finished by now, but the N.C. Department of Transportation granted an 180- day extension to all projects across the state because of wet weather in 2018.    For the sidewalks on Herring (Avenue), we still have some work to do in some places with the traffic signals,    Bass said.    We also have some intersection improvements at Sallie B. Howard and on the north side of Herring.    Safety and improving mobility throughout the area is a cornerstone of the project, but Bass said the effect won   t be evident until all the work is complete.    If there have been any comments about the project, it is about being ready for it to be done,    he said.    But they are excited about all tom what I   ve heard.    Rodger Lentz, Wilson chief planning and development officer, said the project has spurred new businesses, such as the city   s second Wendy   s location and the relocation of Public Tire Warehouse, as well as other investment.    We have seen more inquiries and a fair bit of activity in the residential area where developers have purchased former vacant or less-than-appealing essidential properties and have rehabbed them,    Lentz said. Officials have held meetings for residents in the area in hopes of determining what types of businesses would do well near the redeveloped thoroughfare. Lentz said a grocery store and a bank have risen to the top of the list, but that   s dependent on private developers.    The feeling is that with an improved roadway and improved aesthetics, more development can be attracted,    he said.

Restraining order filed against state Senate hopeful,Lindell J. Kay,Anaheim Bulletin,english,"MIDDLESEX     A state Senate candidate says a restraining order his estranged wife filed against him means he   s just another unjustly accused male victim of the MeToo movement. Retired Air Force Col. Dennis Nielsen is running in the Republican primary for N.C. Senate District 11, which includes all of Nash County and a portion of Johnston County. Dennis Nielsen   s wife Karen Nielsen filed a domestic violence protective order this week. The court order bars Dennis Nielsen from going to his home or anywhere near his wife. Dennis Nielsen is accused of abuse, harassment and inflicting financial servitude, according to statements made by his wife in her complaint. Johnston County Deputy Clerk of Court Sherry Augustine signed the ex parte restraining order on Monday. The order is temporary. A judge will decide whether to extend it at an upcoming hearing. Dennis Nielsen provided the court documents to the newspaper, saying the paperwork is proof any woman can say whatever she wants and officialscally believe her.    I know this is not going to help me, but people need to know what can happen,    Dennis Nielsen said. Gaining momentum in recent years, MeToo involves women taking a stand against harassment and violence by Hollywood moguls, politicians and corporate leaders. A backlash has taken shape in which men accused of such actions claim they   re victims of false or trumped-up charges. Dennis Nielsen compared himself to U.S. Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh, who faced groping accusations during his 2018 confirmation hearings.    He   s notorious for taking things out of context,    Karen Nielsen said of her husband. She said he turned the paperwork over to the newspaper just to embarrass her as he once promised. THE RELATIONSHIP The couple married in June 2018 after knowing each other for three years. They met when she was in his gun store shopping for a firearm. Dennis Nielsen is 71. Karen Nielsen is 50, according to court records.    Some of these more money,    Dennis Nielsen said. Karen Nielsen said that was a joke because her husband doesn   t have any real money. Staying with friends, Dennis Nielsen said he hasn   t been home since being served wit",2020,05-Aug

We're looking forward to having another piece in the future oing to happen there.    There are no set plans for the 1.5-acre Phoenix site, Johnson said, beyond some type of future business use in what remains a busy commercial corridor.

DEVELOPMENT IN COLLEGE OF DUPAGE LAWSUIT,Robert Sanchez,Anaheim Bulletin,english,"Former College of DuPage board Chairwoman Kathy Hamilton is trying to prevent conversations she surreptitiously recorded from being entered as evidence in a wrongful termination lawsuit brought by former COD President Robert Breuder. An attorney for Hamilton this week filed a motion seeking a protective order to stop the taped conversations from being turned over to Breuder, who has requested them as part of his legal action. The motion says disclosing the recordings would expose Hamilton to criminal and civil liability. Recording a conversation without the consent of the others in it generally is against the law in Illinois. The legal fight over the secret recordings comes more than four years after Breuder claimed in a federal lawsuit that he was wrongfully fired. Breuder filed his lawsuit in October 2015, one day after being fired. ",2020,05-Aug

A pledge for police reform,Steve Karnowski,Anaheim Bulletin,english,"MINNEAPOLIS     The Minneapolis Police Department will withdraw from police union contract negotiations, Chief Medaria Arradondo said Wednesday, as he announced initial steps in what he said would be transformational reforms to the agency in the wake of George Floyd   s death. Faced with calls from activists and a majority of City Council members to dismantle or defund the department, Arradondo also said he would use a new system to identify problem officers early and intervene.    We will have a police department that our communities view as legitimate, trusting and working with their best minterests at heart,    he said at a news conference more than two weeks after Floydm died. Awhite officer pressedhis knee into the handcuffed black man   s neck even after he stopped moving and pleading for air.
